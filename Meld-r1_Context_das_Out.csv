See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it. 7.- The Head Librarian - . We are aware of the problem you are referring to. 8.- The Head Librarian - . But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library is very understaffed. 9.- The Head Librarian - . I, I can't help you. 10.- Ross - . Well, fine. 11.- Ross - . Fine! 12.- Ross - . If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself! 13.- Ross - . And don't you follow me!|",7
