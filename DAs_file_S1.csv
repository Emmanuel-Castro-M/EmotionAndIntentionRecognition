Excuse me.,c,c,neu
Do you have your forms?,q,q,dis
Yeah.,ag,ans,neu
Let me see them.,c,s,dis
Is there a problem?,q,q,neu
Who told you to get in this line?,q,q,dis
Okay. But I didn't tell you to get in this line if you are filling out this particular form.,s,s,dis
Well what's the problem?  Let me change it.,q,q,neu
This form is a Z.X.four.,ans,s,dis
"You can't--  This is not the line for Z.X.four.  If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four, you need to have a different form of ID.",ans,ans,dis
What?  I'm getting an ID.  This is why I'm here.  My wallet was stolen.,s,s,dis
No. I need another set of ID to prove this is actually you.,s,s,dis
How am I supposed to get an ID without an ID?  How does a person get an ID in the first place?,q,q,dis
I don't know.  But I need an ID to pass this form along.  I can't just send it along without an ID.,ans,ans,dis
I'm here to get an ID.,s,s,dis
"No.  I need another ID, a separate one.",ans,s,dis
Like what?  Like a birth certificate?,q,q,dis
"A birth certificate, a passport...a student ID; didn't you go to school?  Anything?",q,s,dis
"Yes but my wallet was stolen, I don't have anything.  I don't have any credit cards, I don't have my ID.  Don't you have things on file here?",q,q,dis
"Yeah.  We keep it on file, but we need an ID to access that file.",ans,ans,dis
That's out of control.,o,o,ang
I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID.,o,o,ang
How long have you been working here?,q,q,dis
"Clearly.  You know, do you have like a supervisor or something?",q,q,neu
Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back.,s,s,ang
That would - I would appreciate that.  Yeah.,a,a,dis
Did you get the mail? So you saw my letter?,q,q,sad
Yeah.  I know.,ag,ag,sad
"I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back.",s,o,sad
I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't...,s,s,sad
"I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices.",o,o,neu
"There's people that have given more though, you know?",o,s,sad
I just don't see how they can make you leave when you have a new baby - we have a new kid.,o,o,dis
I know.,ag,ag,sad
"There's babies over there, though, that need mothers.",ans,ans,neu
I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it.,q,q,sad
"Just, you know, kicking myself.",s,s,sad
things just aren't what they seem.,o,s,sad
I know.,ag,ag,dis
I just don't see why it has to be you.,o,o,sad
"If not me then, who?",q,q,sad
What am I going to do? Huh?,q,q,sad
"You'll videotape everything, yeah?",ans,ans,sad
Yeah.,ag,ag,sad
"Maybe you can send it to me, like stream it, yeah?",o,o,sad
Don't you guys have access to computers over there.,q,q,neu
Last month--  Yeah.,ans,ans,sad
I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you.,o,o,sad
I have to find sitters.,s,s,neu
I can't raise a baby by myself.  How?,q,q,sad
"We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh?  Because there is a day care down the street.",ans,ans,sad
I know.,ag,ag,neu
And your mother is close by.,s,s,neu
I'll send you lots of letters.,s,s,sad
And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures.,c,c,sad
It's just not fair.,o,o,dis
So what's up?  What's new?,q,q,neu
Well Vegas was awesome.,ans,ans,hap
Yeah.  I heard.,ag,ag,neu
"And, um, I got married.",s,s,hap
Shut up.  No- in Vegas?,q,q,sur
Yeah.  In the old town part.,ans,ans,hap
Who did you marry?,q,q,hap
Um- Yes.  It was very romantic.,ans,ans,hap
It was at the slot machines.,s,s,hap
"Uhuh, uhuh.  He won big and he-and he realized that the only thing that would make it better was me as his bride.",s,s,hap
He turned to you and was like...,s,s,neu
[LAUGHTER] That's really romantic.,o,o,hap
"Yeah.  Well.  You know, because he's leaving the next day.",ag,ag,hap
Yeah.,ag,ag,neu
But we're going to have a honeymoon cruise.,s,s,hap
"Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship, too, in- in England or whatever?",q,q,neu
Oh.  I hadn't even thought about that.,ans,ans,hap
Yeah.  But he'll have like a long visa.  Can you go visit then for a long time?,q,q,neu
Oh.  Totally.,ag,ag,hap
I guess I'll-  I guess I'll have an internet husband.[LAUGHTER],ans,ans,hap
Like you need another one of those.[LAUGHTER],o,o,hap
Is that your phone?,q,q,hap
"Yeah, so [LAUGHTER] He's calling me now",ans,ans,hap
He loves you.,o,s,hap
"He likes to keep tabs, you know.",s,s,hap
How much did he win at the slot?,q,q,neu
"Uh, I think seven hundred and fifty dollars.",ans,ans,neu
Really? Penny slots?,q,q,sur
Penny slots. That's what he plays.,ans,ans,neu
Wow.,b,a,sur
Yeah.,ag,ag,neu
I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Fortune quarters. But it just costs so much.  I don't know.,s,s,neu
Yeah.  We played Wheel of Fortune pennies.  It's like a giant thing with like-,s,s,hap
"But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks.",o,o,neu
Fifty bucks. Mmhmm.,ans,b,neu
"like, wait, but it's just pennies.  You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you.",o,o,neu
Yeah.,ag,ag,neu
Well so now we're married. We have cat children.,s,s,hap
Awesome.,a,a,hap
[LAUGHTER] Cat babies.,s,s,hap
"We renamed Brenda, Lumber Janet.",s,s,hap
That's fair enough.,o,o,neu
She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER],s,s,hap
"Have you tried, uh, Craig's List?",q,q,neu
"Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing?",q,q,neu
Yeah.,ag,ag,neu
I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that.,o,o,neu
No.  There's regular jobs on there.,dag,dag,neu
"I don't know.  I mean I've been looking for so long that I just figured that--  I mean, I think things like Monster are a lot more reliable than just some random free board.",o,o,dis
Uh huh.,b,b,neu
I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it.,s,s,neu
He's like a manager for a theatre.,ans,ans,neu
He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job.,ans,ans,neu
He just...,b,b,neu
you know what?  I heard about that job.  I applied for that.,s,s,neu
You did?,q,q,neu
Yeah.  I saw a posting at the theatre.,ans,ans,dis
Yeah.,ag,b,neu
You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right?,q,q,neu
Yeah.,ag,ans,neu
Hmm.,b,b,neu
I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and--,ans,ans,neu
Yeah.  Do you have a resume?,q,q,neu
It's kind of helpful when getting a job.,o,o,neu
I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at.,s,s,neu
Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.,o,o,neu
Yeah.,ag,ag,neu
"No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--",s,s,neu
I'm there in front of them.  I'm telling them what I'm good at.,s,s,dis
"Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too.",o,o,neu
Why?  It's a piece of paper.,q,q,dis
"No.  But it has an outline, you know.",ans,ans,neu
"I just don't want this paper trail, you know.  I just don't want things following me around, like-.",s,s,dis
"I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe--",ag,ag,neu
"It's just-- You know, I've had this problem before.  You're not the first person to tell me that I need a resume but...",s,s,dis
Yeah.,ag,b,neu
"Okay, yeah.  I would imagine.",ag,ag,neu
"Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now.",o,o,neu
"That's baloney, that's baloney.",o,o,dis
Please.,c,dag,dis
maybe get a car.,o,o,neu
"I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe.",o,o,neu
you think that you're better than me because I don't have a car?,q,q,dis
I didn't say that.,dag,dag,neu
"You know, you're riding the bus, too.",o,s,dis
"I am riding the bus, but by choice.",o,o,neu
Why?  What choice?,q,q,dis
"To save the environment, carpool.",o,ans,neu
You're saving the environment. mmhmm,s,s,dis
Yes.  One less car at a time.,ag,ag,neu
Interesting.  That's fantastic.,a,a,dis
Mmhmm.,b,b,neu
"You know, you don't have to take out your frustration on me, you know, just because...",s,s,dis
I'm not frustrated.,dag,dag,ang
...you can't get a job and refuse to have a resume.,s,s,dis
Who do you think you are?,q,q,ang
I don't think I'm anyone.,ans,ans,neu
You are so high and mighty.  I just--,o,o,ang
I- I-I didn't-- okay.,b,b,neu
Oh.  I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to.,o,o,ang
What? Oh.  So now you're...,s,s,dis
"The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to.",o,o,ang
you know what?  You don't have to take your anger and your hurt out on me.,c,c,dis
I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice.,o,o,ang
Hi.,g,g,dis
Hi.  Thanks for waiting.,g,g,neu
Yeah. This is the fourth line that I have been in.,s,s,dis
Can I help you?,q,q,hap
Uh huh.,b,b,hap
I need my bag.,s,s,dis
Okay.,ag,b,neu
"I flew in over three hours ago, I've been in four different lines.",s,s,dis
Okay.,ag,b,neu
I waited the entire baggage- I waited for the whole baggage carousel four times.  They told me to go to the next one.  I waited through that for three planes and now I'm here.,s,s,dis
Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there.,q,q,neu
Nash.,ans,ans,dis
Okay.,ag,b,neu
all right- okay.  And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue?,q,q,neu
Yes.,ans,ag,dis
Flight seven fourteen.,s,s,ang
Uh-huh.,b,b,neu
"Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here?",q,q,ang
"Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--",ans,ans,neu
"I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um-",ans,s,neu
"we've mistakenly lost your baggage.  We're very sorry.  On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience.  I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us.  I'm very sorry, once again...",ap,ap,neu
"for such an inconvenience and your bag, but",ap,ap,neu
Is this a joke?,q,q,ang
Yeah.,ag,b,neu
"No, no.",ans,dag,neu
"Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline.",q,q,ang
"No, no.  This is real.",ans,ans,neu
"No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because...",s,ans,neu
this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere.,s,s,neu
"You're kidding me, this is a joke.",o,o,ang
Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive.,q,q,ang
Yes.,ans,b,neu
I know.,ag,ag,neu
We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks.,s,s,ang
I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.,c,c,ang
Okay. Calm-,c,c,neu
"Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really",s,s,neu
Do you understand who my husband is?,q,q,ang
"If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it.",o,o,ang
"We are actually not even allowed--  you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars.  We don't have to do that.",s,s,neu
Oh-Oh.  It's a gift.  You're-You're helping me out here?,q,q,ang
It's a gift.,ans,ans,neu
"You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.",s,s,neu
You are cruising for a bruising.  You are in so much trouble.,s,o,ang
With the amount of--,s,s,neu
Who's in charge?  Who is the president of Jet Blue?,q,q,ang
"Um, actually, I don't know. I don't know. Oh really?",ans,ans,neu
Because I probably know him.,s,s,ang
Yeah.,ag,ag,ang
Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--,o,o,neu
"I don't want money, I want my clothes.",s,s,ang
"Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry.",s,s,neu
What's your name?,q,q,ang
Oh.  My name is Sean. Hi.,ans,ans,neu
"Badge number?  Uh, no.  You can just take my employee number I guess.",ans,ans,sur
Okay.  I'll do that.,ag,ag,ang
Why?  Have I done something wrong?  Have I given you bad service?  I feel like I have done the best I could.,q,q,sur
I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet.,ans,ans,ang
"If you want, you can write a letter.  I can give you the address. Yes.  An angry--",s,s,neu
A letter? I'll make a personal phone call.,s,s,ang
"Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more...",o,o,neu
"I'm sorry, Joy.",ap,ap,sad
Is there anything I can get you?  Do you want me to take care of anything for you or...?,q,q,neu
...pick up anything?,q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,sad
You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out.,o,o,sad
That's sweet.,o,a,neu
Thank you.,g,g,neu
I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.,ans,s,sad
"I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city.",s,s,sad
Hmm.,b,b,neu
So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.,s,s,sad
So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And-,s,s,sad
"this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there.",s,s,neu
Oh.  She was there?,q,q,neu
"Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it.",o,s,sad
"And I, you know, I mean, I said I was sorry and I brought it back to her kind of and I like put it on the ground and she was like, no, it's fine.  She was like, I would rather have her back, honestly.",s,s,sad
Mmhmm.,b,b,neu
"I don't know.  It just, like, I felt so bad because I shouldn't have done it.  I don't know.  Whatever.",o,o,sad
Yeah.,ag,b,sad
I don't know.,s,s,sad
How long were you there for?,q,q,neu
At the cemetery?,q,q,sad
Mmhmm.,b,b,neu
couple hours.,ans,ans,sad
"I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day.  We ran through the sprinklers.",s,s,neu
Oh really?,q,q,neu
You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery?,q,q,neu
Is it a big cemetery?,q,q,neu
Yeah.  It's huge.  Redlands is an old city so they have lots and lots of stones.,ans,ans,neu
"Oh, so they're like really old too, really old ones?",q,q,neu
Yeah.,ag,ag,neu
"It's weird.  Whenever I go back to town, I think of her.  I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one.  And yeah.  She had cancer, she had two brain tumors.",o,s,sad
"My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her.",s,s,sad
She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day.,s,s,sad
Mmhmm.,b,b,neu
Umm. Yeah.,b,b,sad
"And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm...",s,s,sad
"But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool.",s,s,sad
Mmhmm.,b,b,neu
"Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and-",ans,ans,sad
So she wrote a lot of poetry?,q,q,neu
"There's another one, I can't remember.",ans,ans,neu
"I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know?",s,s,sad
Did you get the letter?,q,q,hap
"Yes.  There's a big envelope it says, you're in. I know.",ans,ans,hap
Yeah. That is so awesome.,a,a,hap
Oh my God. What are you going to do? [LAUGHTER],q,q,hap
"Oh-Yeah, I bet you're really excited. Oh.  That's what loans are for?  Right? Exactly.",o,o,hap
"I'm really excited.  Yeah. I don't know how I'm going to pay for anything, but... I also- Yeah.  Loans, too, yeah. I applied, though, for a bunch of grants and scholarships so I'm still waiting to hear on that.",s,s,hap
"Oh.  Good, good.  That's awesome. Are you going to stay around here?  Or are you going to like get a different neighborhood- you going to move to a different neighborhood?",q,q,hap
"Oh- I know, I know, I know, I know.",ag,ag,hap
"I don't know.  I spend so much time commuting as it is, I'd rather.",ans,ans,hap
This is so- I am so happy that you're going to stay.  You're not going to...We should totally throw a party.,o,o,hap
I know. We should throw a party.,ag,ag,hap
A rapper party ho. Yeah. Okay.,ag,ag,hap
"I am just- Yeah.  I'm sticking around, I'm just doing my thing.  I'm living here.  I'm so glad you're going to stay, I'm so glad you're going to be here. Yeah. Woo.",s,ans,hap
Yeah.  Big time.,ag,ag,hap
Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Yay. So what major?  What are you doing?,q,q,hap
Yeah.  I'm not sure.,ans,o,hap
Is this a Masters or a P.h.D.?  Or can you...? Nice,q,q,neu
Umm...P.h.D. [LAUGHTER],ans,ans,hap
"That's good.  Don't you have to like teach a class, too, when you do that?",q,q,neu
"Teacher. Mrs. Nash, I have a question.",s,s,hap
So I get to mold young minds. Mrs.?  That's my mother.,o,o,hap
You have to get married.  Well you are married to Chuck.  You're Mrs. Nash.  Not to be confused with Mrs. Dash which is the popular seasoning.,s,s,hap
"I would be like- Oh. Right, right, right.",q,s,hap
Yay...School's fun.,o,ag,hap
"Of course, right.  That's where the real money is, being a student.",o,o,neu
That's how you get the big bucks.  Are you messing with the chair? Don't ruin it.,c,c,hap
"I know. I made such a mess of it, the entire time.  The last three things I've done, I've ruined everything, I think. Mm-hmm.  Yeah.",ag,ag,hap
What's he going to say?,q,q,dis
He saw it.,s,s,neu
How could he see it?  I was the first one up; he was still in bed.,q,q,sur
He was out here when it broke.,ans,ans,neu
Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked.,ans,ans,neu
I don't know.,s,ans,neu
"He's dreaming of him again, walking around.",s,s,neu
I guess he is.,ag,ag,neu
"I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing, Mom, you've made a terrible mistake with father.",o,ans,dis
You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,ans,ans,neu
What do you want to do?  Argue with him?,q,q,dis
I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive.,ans,ans,dis
"You know?  Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him, dreaming of him?   Do we contradict him?  Do we say, we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years now?",o,o,dis
You can't say that to him.,ans,c,dis
We've got to say it to him.,c,dag,neu
Where's the proof?  Do you have any proof?,q,q,dis
"For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane.",ans,ans,dis
"To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face.  But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you?",o,o,dis
"Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.",c,c,neu
"All right, all right, all right.  You know why I asked Annie here, right?",q,q,dis
Why?,q,q,dis
You know.,ans,ans,neu
"Well I got an idea, but what's your story?",q,q,neu
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,ans,ans,neu
You know it's not just my business.,dag,dag,neu
"So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it?",s,s,neu
Then it's not just my business.,o,o,dis
"You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",o,o,ang
She's not Larry's girl.,dag,dag,dis
"From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl.",s,s,dis
"Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go.",s,s,dis
"I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time.",o,o,dis
"You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that.",o,o,dis
To hell with that.,dag,o,dis
I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet?,q,q,dis
I wanted to get this settled first.,ans,ans,neu
Well how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.,q,q,dis
"Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him.",ans,ans,neu
And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.,c,c,neu
The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,o,o,dis
So what.  I'm not fast with women.,ag,o,dis
Why does it have to be Annie?,q,q,dis
Because it is.,s,ans,dis
Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all.,dag,dag,dis
I don't know.,s,s,dis
"You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.",s,s,dis
"I can't help it, I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her, you know?  These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.",s,s,dis
"Mom, what do you want?  A diagram?",q,q,dis
I don't want a diagram.,ans,ans,dis
He thinks he's coming back Chris.,s,s,dis
"You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead...",s,s,dis
...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.,s,s,dis
"All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING]",a,ag,dis
Just give it some more thought.,c,c,neu
"I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy.",o,o,dis
"But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else.",s,s,dis
What the hell is this?,q,q,ang
"I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.",s,s,neu
"I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.",o,o,dis
You have a business here.  What the hell is this?,q,q,ang
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ans,ans,dis
Oh.  Must you be inspired?,q,q,ang
"Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy.",ans,ans,dis
"I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.  Now it's just where to find it.",o,o,dis
You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this?,q,q,dis
"On this, I would.",ans,ans,neu
Well you don't want to think like that.,c,c,dis
Then help me stay here.,c,c,neu
"All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.",s,s,ang
I know that.  Then just help me stay here.,c,c,dis
Just don't think like that.,c,c,ang
Well I am thinking like that.,dag,s,dis
"I don't understand you, do I?",q,q,dis
No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,ans,ans,dis
I can see that.,ag,ag,dis
Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.,ans,ans,neu
[BREATHING] You don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything more than he told you.,s,s,dis
He's not going to marry her.,c,c,ang
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,q,q,neu
It's got that about it.,ans,ans,ang
"What is going on here, Joe?",q,q,ang
Now listen.,c,c,dis
She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.,s,s,ang
You can't read her mind.,o,s,dis
"Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.",q,q,ang
How do you know why she waited?,q,q,neu
"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.",ans,ans,ang
"Hey look, it's a nice day, huh?  Why are we arguing?",q,q,dis
"Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",o,o,ang
What do you want me to do? What do you want?,q,q,dis
"I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.",ans,ans,ang
I won't stand for any nonsense.,o,s,ang
Kate.,oth,oth,dis
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look.",o,o,ang
[BREATHING],oth,oth,dis
Calm yourself.,c,c,dis
"Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe.",s,s,ang
Okay. Calm yourself.,c,c,dis
"I know. All right, all right. All right. Okay.  Calm yourself. What does that mean, me above all?",q,q,dis
I can't help it.,o,s,dis
"What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",q,q,ang
You're the only one who still loves his parents.,o,o,neu
"I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it?",q,q,neu
It's not so bad; it's a good thing.,ans,ans,neu
"[BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.",o,o,neu
You're not sorry you came.,q,q,neu
"I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay.",ans,ans,neu
"For one thing, your mother much as told me to go.",ans,ans,neu
Well.,b,b,neu
"And then, you.  You've been kind of...",s,s,neu
What?,q,q,neu
Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.,o,o,neu
Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set.,s,s,neu
I knew they would.,ag,ag,neu
"Well sure, from your mother's point of view.  Why else would I come?",ans,ans,neu
"I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came.",ans,ans,neu
[BREATHING],oth,oth,hap
"I love you. Annie, I love you.",o,s,hap
[LAUGHTER],oth,oth,hap
"I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say.",s,s,hap
[LAUGHTER],oth,oth,hap
"Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch.  I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us.",s,o,hap
No. No,dag,dag,hap
"Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time.",s,s,neu
I almost got married two years ago.,ans,ans,neu
You started to write me.,ans,ans,neu
You felt something that far back?,q,q,sur
Every day since.,ans,ans,hap
Why didn't you let me know?,q,q,hap
Give me a...,c,c,hap
Give me a kiss.,c,c,hap
beating around the bush.,ans,ans,hap
"I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me.",s,s,hap
"Oh Annie, we are going to live now.  I am going to make you so happy.",o,o,hap
Not like that you're not.,o,o,hap
I kissed you.,s,s,hap
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.",o,c,neu
"Hey, let's drive some place.  Huh?  Let's get out of here.",s,c,sad
No it's nothing like that. It's-,ans,ans,sad
Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.,ans,ans,sad
I don't even know how to start.,s,s,sad
"It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company?",q,q,sad
"Yeah, sure.",ans,ag,neu
Well I lost them.,s,s,sad
How many?,q,q,neu
Pretty much all.,ans,ans,sad
"Aw, geez.",b,b,sad
You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?,o,o,sad
"Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.",s,s,sad
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.",o,o,sad
Mmhmm.,b,b,neu
"To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.",o,o,sad
"But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work.",s,s,sad
And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.,o,o,sad
I just want you to know Annie.,ans,ans,neu
What would I do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
Fine.,ans,ans,neu
"Okay.  Is that, is that--",ag,ag,hap
[BREATHING],oth,oth,dis
What flashlight?,q,q,sur
"The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?",ans,ans,neu
That's not your flashlight.,s,dag,neu
Whose is it?,q,q,neu
"Oh...well. Yeah, of course.",ag,ag,neu
You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.,s,s,ang
No.,ans,dag,neu
How's that supposed to make me feel?,q,q,ang
"Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight.",ans,ans,neu
"Naturally.  God, how could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out, though.",o,o,dis
Do they always run during a full moon?  I don't remember.  Was it full last year?,q,q,neu
Yeah.,ag,ans,neu
"Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket.",q,q,neu
"Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh?",s,o,neu
"God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up.",o,o,hap
[LAUGHTER],oth,oth,hap
I'm cold.,s,s,sad
Do you want my jacket?,q,q,dis
Right.,ag,ag,neu
"Wait, that's my point, too.",s,s,neu
"Well, then let's go.",c,c,dis
"No, no.  Okay.  That's not my point.  My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?",dag,q,dis
Not particularly.,ans,ans,neu
Why not?,q,q,neu
"Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up.",o,o,neu
"Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die.",s,s,dis
Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.,s,o,neu
This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy.,o,o,neu
Yeah they do.,dag,dag,dis
Oh Augie,b,b,dis
"There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested.",o,o,neu
For real?,q,q,sur
Yeah.,ag,ans,dis
"God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life?",q,s,neu
"And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.",s,s,neu
Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.,s,s,neu
Hmm.  We didn't see them the year before either.,s,s,dis
"We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things.",o,o,neu
"Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed.",s,s,hap
"God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this.",c,c,hap
"Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming.",s,s,hap
It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge.,o,o,hap
That's the wind.,s,o,neu
So what do you think?,q,q,hap
About what?,q,q,neu
"About all of that, about all I was talking about.",ans,ans,hap
"Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm.",c,c,hap
That's the wind.,s,o,neu
"Well, so, what do you think?",q,q,hap
About what?,q,q,neu
About what I was saying.,ans,ans,neu
"Not just me, look at all of these people.",dag,s,dis
"Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?",q,q,neu
"Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting.",ans,ans,ang
"Well then, what's bugging you?",q,q,dis
We just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like.,ans,ans,dis
"There is nothing to it; we come down here, the fish arrive, they flop around, they do their fish thing.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish and we go home.",s,s,dis
"For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive.",o,o,ang
Why not?,q,q,dis
Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever?,q,q,ang
We've missed them twice.,ans,ans,dis
Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.,s,s,ang
They'll show up this time.,o,o,dis
I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish never show up.,s,s,dis
You don't understand anything I am saying.,s,dag,dis
No. Of course not.,dag,ag,dis
"I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is.",o,o,sad
"It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatized over.",o,o,dis
"For God's sake, this is not about fish.",s,dag,ang
Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here.,s,s,dis
"Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go.",s,s,neu
"Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage.",s,s,neu
Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married.,s,s,neu
"You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be.",s,s,hap
"It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that.",s,s,neu
dancing barefoot in the sand.,s,s,dis
"That's what it is?  Right?  You want this to be like the other time, right?",q,q,dis
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,ans,ans,sad
Sure.  All right.  Okay.,ag,ag,neu
"Listen, do you want to dance?",q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,neu
Do you want me to go get some champagne?,q,q,neu
Do you want to take off your shoes?,q,q,hap
"No, no. Nothing.",ans,ans,dis
Do you want to get married again?,q,q,hap
No.,ans,ans,neu
What?  What?  Do you want a divorce?,q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,dis
[BREATHING],oth,oth,dis
"No I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all roses and peaches and the bills would just pay themselves.  And we'll have three, fat rosy cheeked children.  Huh, baby, the joke's on us.  Because you know what you get?",o,o,dis
Do you know what you get?  You get this.,s,s,dis
This? What is this?  This is nothing.  This isn't even anything.,o,o,dis
Yes it is.,dag,dag,neu
"I mean this is a lot of things, but it's just...",o,o,dis
[BREATHING],oth,oth,dis
Do you understand what I am saying?,q,q,dis
I'm doing the best I can.,ans,ans,dis
"I know you are Augie, I know.",ag,ag,sad
"I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else.",o,o,sad
"Maybe if you were with someone else, too.",o,o,sad
I didn't say that.,dag,dag,sad
I just- I know I don't make you happy.,o,o,sad
"Don't be ridiculous.  Anything that- anything I am doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",o,s,sur
Yeah?,q,q,sur
Yeah.  Don't you know that?,q,q,sur
"You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself.",o,o,sad
"You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't.",s,s,neu
"So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person.",o,o,neu
"I don't know, it seemed like such a good spot to me.",o,o,dis
"We have a great view of the moon from here, though, huh?",s,s,neu
"Hmm.  I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon.",ag,a,hap
[BREATHING],oth,oth,neu
And look what I got here.,c,c,hap
"Augie, you bought refreshments.",s,s,hap
I guess we don't need glasses.,s,o,hap
[BREATHING],oth,oth,hap
Do you want to go home?  Are you cold?,q,q,neu
I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all.,s,s,hap
"Augie, I'm sorry.",ap,ap,sad
"Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",o,o,neu
Or not.,ag,o,neu
Or not.,ag,ag,hap
Good God.,s,s,fea
Is it them?,q,q,fea
I wonder.,ans,s,fea
Freda is the only one who knows we are here.  She wouldn't ring up.,s,o,fea
It must be them then.,s,o,fea
It had to happen sooner or later.  What are we going to do?,q,q,fea
[BREATHING],oth,oth,fea
I don't care then.,s,s,hap
No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER],s,s,hap
[LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine.,s,s,hap
What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER],q,q,hap
We'll behave exquisitely.,ans,ans,hap
With perfect poise.,s,s,hap
I think I shall do a curtsy.,o,o,hap
"It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?",o,o,hap
Yes.  Meaning just that.,ans,ans,hap
"Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",q,s,hap
Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious.,c,c,hap
Who's they?,q,q,hap
Who knows?,ans,q,hap
Yes.  Yes with all of his might.,ans,ans,hap
"Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children.",c,c,hap
[LAUGHTER],oth,oth,hap
Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.,c,c,hap
"Oh Elliott, worms don't pop.",s,s,hap
"Oh See, I don't care what you do, see.  You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world.  I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best.",o,o,hap
"Aw.  Thank you, darling.  The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.",o,s,hap
"Oh Charles, that was his name.  He did wiggle so beautifully.",s,s,hap
It was a terrible thing.  I hated it.,o,o,dis
"That was a rouser, wasn't it?",q,q,hap
"The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",s,s,hap
[LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER],s,s,hap
[LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then.,s,s,hap
[LAUGHTER] And very much sillier.,o,o,hap
And very much sillier.,o,o,hap
However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,o,o,neu
Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.,dag,s,hap
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,s,s,neu
"Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch.",s,s,hap
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,s,o,neu
I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,dag,dag,neu
"Well, you let him kiss you, huh?  You said you did.",s,s,dis
"Well, what of it?",q,q,neu
What about me?,q,q,ang
Oh dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.,o,o,dis
So am I.  I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE]  Do you want some brandy?,q,q,dis
"I'll have a little, I think.",s,s,neu
"No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones.",s,s,neu
"You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on.",o,o,dis
Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment.,o,o,dis
Don't be stupid.,c,c,ang
"Really, Amanda.",dag,dag,ang
What?,q,q,ang
Nothing.,ans,ans,dis
"you going out somewhere, dear?",q,q,neu
No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.,ans,ans,ang
Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man.,o,o,ang
"Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true.",ag,ag,neu
No it isn't.,dag,dag,ang
Yes it is.,dag,dag,neu
You shut up.,c,c,ang
"Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable.",o,o,ang
"Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder.",o,o,ang
Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap.,dag,dag,ang
They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.,o,o,ang
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,q,q,ang
"Yes I did, quite a lot.",ans,ans,ang
"And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow.",o,o,ang
Mind your own business.,c,c,ang
"You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk.",o,o,ang
I think I am not in the least bit drunk.,o,o,ang
You've always had a weak head.,o,o,ang
I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.,o,s,ang
"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",o,o,ang
"That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four?  Or a child of six?  Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots.",q,o,ang
Oh shut up.,c,c,ang
Shut up.,c,c,ang
"Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy.",o,o,ang
"Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs.",c,c,ang
Why?,q,q,neu
There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.,s,s,neu
Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.,q,s,ang
They are away in Tunis.,ans,s,neu
This is no time of year for Tunis.,o,o,neu
I will do no such thing.,dag,dag,ang
Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,dag,o,ang
"Will you turn that off, it's driving me mad.",q,q,ang
"You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself.",o,o,ang
Turn it off.,c,c,ang
"I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",o,o,ang
"Amanda, listen, listen.",c,c,ang
Oh.  That's very amusing indeed.,dag,o,ang
"Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",o,o,ang
"You are a vile, ill-tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I never want to see you again as long as I live.",o,o,ang
This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever.,s,o,ang
You're not going like this.,c,s,ang
Oh.  Yes I am.,dag,ans,ang
You're not.,dag,dag,ang
"Yes I am.   Stop it. Stop it.  Let go of me. Oh.  You're a cruel fiend.  I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again?  Never, never, never. I hope you die in torment, you brute beast cad.",o,o,ang
"Shut up. Shut up. God, I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee.  You are a vile, ill-tempered, mean little wench and I never want to see you again as long as I live.",o,o,ang
Next.,c,c,ang
"Yes, me. Okay, okay here we go.",ans,s,dis
My window is open.,s,s,ang
"Okay, so filled out all these forms  --",s,s,dis
and I have This form of ID here so...,s,s,dis
"Yes, Jones.",ans,ans,neu
What are you... what's...What are you applying for?,q,q,dis
I'm just applying for another ID.,s,ans,dis
"Yes.  I'm supposed to have three forms of ID for this.  It's a long story, I'm supposed to have three forms of ID for this other job I really don't get into but I need another...",s,s,dis
"I have it right here, yes.",s,s,dis
"No, I need your ID to give you a second ID.",s,s,ang

"Well, that's only your business, Chris.",o,o,dis
You know it's not just my business.,dag,dag,dis
"Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business.",o,o,ang
So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it?,q,s,dis
"See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh?",o,o,ang
I'm just saying.,s,s,dis
I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.,ap,s,ang
She is not Larry's girl.,dag,dag,ang
"From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.",s,s,ang
I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.  All my life...,o,o,dis
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.,o,o,neu
To hell with that.,dag,o,ang
Did you ask Annie yet?,q,q,neu
"No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first.",ans,ans,sad
"Well, how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels same way your father does.",q,q,dis
"The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.",o,o,dis
So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women.,o,o,dis
I don't see why it has to be Annie.,s,q,ang
Because it is.,s,ans,dis
"That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.",s,s,ang
"I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her.  She is what I think of when I think of a wife.",s,s,dis
"He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.",s,s,sad
"Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't.",ans,q,ang
I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing.,s,s,dis
"When I think of a family, when I think of my future I see Annie in the center of that and you know and if that can't happen here then I'll go somewhere else.",o,o,dis
What the hell is this?,q,q,sur
I'll leave.  I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York.,ans,ans,dis
Are you crazy?,q,q,ang
You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this?,q,q,ang
Business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ans,ans,ang
"Oh, must you be inspired.",q,q,ang
"Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that.",ans,ans,ang
If that can't happen here...,s,s,dis
"Yes, on this I would.",ans,ans,neu
"Well, you don't want to think like that.",c,c,ang
Then help me stay here mom.,c,c,sad
"All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you.",s,s,ang
Then help me stay.,c,c,sad
"Well, you don't think like that.",c,c,ang
I am thinking like that.,dag,s,ang
"I don't understand you, do I?",q,q,ang
"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",ans,ans,sad
"Well, I can see that.",ag,ag,ang
Why did he invite her here?,q,q,ang
"Well, maybe he wanted see her.",ans,ans,neu
It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden?,q,q,ang
"Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her?",q,q,neu
Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything he told you.,c,s,dis
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,q,q,dis
Oh so what?,q,b,dis
"What is going on here, Joe?",q,ans,ang
"Okay, now listen, kids...",c,c,dis
The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not.,s,s,ang
Listen. Line. You can't read her mind.,s,s,dis
And how do you know why she's waited.,q,q,neu
"Okay, look it's a beautiful day.  Why are we arguing?",q,q,dis
"Nobody in this house dares take away her faith Joe.  Her- strangers might but not her father, not her brother.",o,o,dis
What do you want me to do?  What do you want?,q,q,dis
"I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",o,o,ang
Kate...,oth,oth,dis
[BREATHING],oth,oth,dis
"Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look.",o,o,ang
"All right, calm yourself.",c,c,dis
"Believe with me Joe, you got to believe. Only last week a boy came back missing longer then Larry you read it yourself.",s,s,ang
"Okay, calm yourself. Alright.",c,c,dis
calm yourself.,c,c,dis
You above all have got to believe. Just don't stop believing.,c,c,ang
What does that mean? Me above all? What does that mean?,q,q,ang
Look at you. You're shaking.,s,s,ang
"What the hell do you want from me, Kate?",q,q,ang
The only one I know still love his parents.,o,o,neu
"Yeah, that kind of went out of style didn't it?",q,q,hap
Oh it's not bad thing it's good thing.,ans,ans,neu
You're not sorry you came?,q,q,hap
"Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here.",ans,ans,sad
Why not?,q,q,sad
For one thing your mother as much as told me to go.,ans,ans,neu
[BREATHING] And then you've been kind of...,s,s,sad
What?,q,q,neu
You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.,o,o,sad
You did?,q,q,neu
From her point of view why else would I come?,ans,ans,neu
Yeah--,ag,ag,neu
"Ann, I love you.  I love you.",o,s,hap
I almost got married two years ago.,ans,s,neu
Why didn't you?,q,q,neu
Everyday since.,ans,ans,hap
why didn't you let me know?,q,q,hap
"Because I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote me and then when you did, well, you sure can be ambiguous you know.",ans,ans,hap
I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.,s,s,hap
I'll never forgive you for waiting so long.  All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you.,s,s,hap
I kissed you.,s,s,hap
"Chris, what's the matter?",q,q,sad
Do you want to go somewhere?  Let's go.,q,q,sad
"No, what is it?  Is your mother?",q,q,sad
"No, no, it's nothing like that.",ans,ans,sad
I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now.,ans,ans,sad
You got to tell me.,c,c,sad
I don't know.,s,s,sad
It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.,s,s,sad
Wouldn't work like this.,o,o,sad
you know over seas I was in command of the company?,q,q,sad
"Yeah, sure.",ans,ag,sad
Well I lost them.,s,s,sad
How many?,q,q,sad
Pretty much all.,ans,ans,sad
[BREATHING]. Geez.,b,b,sad
"Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men, you know.",o,o,sad
"For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.",s,s,sad
He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had.,s,s,sad
"They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today...",o,o,sad
"And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument...",s,s,sad
"You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know.",o,o,sad
"I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all...",s,s,sad
You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again...,s,s,sad
And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.,s,s,sad
Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.,s,s,sad
Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...,o,o,sad
And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it.,o,o,sad
I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too.,o,o,sad
Do you still feel that way?,q,q,sad
I want you to know Annie.,ans,ans,sad
I'm going to make a fortune for you.,s,s,hap
What would I do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
"What time is it?  God, this is great, isn't it?  I can't believe it.",q,q,hap
"Of course I did want to a little further up the coast you know get away from all the lights and people and everything.  Is it midnight, do they always start at midnight?  Is that what it is midnight?  How you doing, huh? You okay?  That's good.",q,q,hap
"Look, there what's that, what's that?  Is it--",q,q,hap
Ugh...,b,b,dis
"Oh, no I can't tell though.  Although probably if you can't tell it probably isn't them right, yeah.  Probably going to be like unmistakable, right?",o,o,hap
"Gosh, this is great, isn't it?  This is awesome.  Oh, no you know what I forgot?",q,q,hap
What flashlight?,q,q,sur
Flashlight the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?,ans,ans,neu
"Oh, well, yeah of course.",ag,ag,neu
"You keep saying ""my flashlight"" like somehow it's just yours. How's that supposed to make me feel?",q,q,ang
"Of course, our flashlight.  What's your is mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight.",ans,ans,neu
"Gosh, I should have brought it. I can't believe I forgot that.",s,s,neu
No.,ans,ans,neu
"You know what we should've brought a blanket too.  Man, our blanket, our blanket.  Wish I had six-pack too, a six-pack would be just the ticket right about now, huh, six-pack.",o,o,hap
I'm fine.,ans,ans,neu
"Oh yeah, I'm so excited right now I'm like a kid.",o,o,hap
I can't believe I got out of the house without my fly zipped up even.,o,o,hap
I wonder if they can hear me talk,o,o,hap
I'm cold.,s,s,dis
Do you want my jacket?,q,q,dis
"It's after eleven, let's go home.",s,c,dis
What are you kidding?  We just got here.  We don't want to turn around and go home now.  What's the point coming all the way down here?,q,q,dis
There is no point.,ans,ans,dis
Right.,ag,ag,neu
That's my point.,s,s,dis
That's my point too.,ag,s,neu
Then let's go.,c,c,ang
"No, wait no, no that's not my point.  My point is there is no point and coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home.",dag,s,dis
Why not?,q,q,dis
It's not stupid.  It's a natural phenomenon.,o,o,dis
People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.,o,o,ang
"Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die.",s,s,ang
"I don't know what you're so excited about.  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about, it's fish, it's a fish nobody even eats.",o,o,dis
"Yeah, they do.",dag,dag,neu
"Oh, Augie.",b,b,dis
"Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know.",o,o,hap
"It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this.",o,o,hap
I'm not.,s,s,dis
Yes.,ans,ans,ang
All right.,ag,ag,dis
"I don't get it though, I mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life...",s,s,dis
And last year I remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn't realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car.,s,s,dis
"Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.",s,s,ang
We just weren't in a good spot though.,s,s,neu
We didn't see them the year before either.,s,s,ang
"Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay?  So just--just think about it all right?  Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it...",c,c,neu
"Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way...",s,s,hap
"They don't know why, we don't know why.  No one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction...",s,s,hap
They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming...,s,s,hap
Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one...,s,s,hap
"And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here...",s,s,hap
It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind.,s,s,hap
"It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm.",o,s,hap
...to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death...,s,s,hap
"Look at this, my hairs are standing up my arm. I'm giving myself goose bumps.",c,c,hap
That's the wind.,s,o,neu
"Well, so?  What do you think?",q,q,hap
I think it's ridiculous.,o,o,dis
It's a PR.,o,o,dis
"It's not just me, okay?  Look at like all the people.",dag,dag,dis
They're all told the same thing.,s,o,dis
"Everybody is believes that it keeps them excited, you know it keeps them coming back for more.",o,o,dis
"Everybody keeps thinking that they can just find the right spot, you know they'll get it on the action.",o,o,dis
Their life will start then.,o,o,dis
I'm sorry it still just fish to me.,ans,ans,dis
Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period?,q,q,neu
"Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.",ans,ans,ang
"I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.",ans,ans,ang
"Is not supposed to like anything.  We come down here, we look at the fish, they arrive, we go woo-ah fish.",s,s,dis
"Oh. Grow up Augie, the fish are not going to come.",o,o,dis
Why not?,q,q,dis
"Because they never do.  Do they, have they ever?",q,q,ang
We missed them twice.,ans,ans,neu
Twice is every year we've tried that's ever.,s,s,ang
"Okay we'll see them this year, this is a much better spot. Trust me.",o,o,dis
No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus.,dag,dag,ang
"I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show.",s,s,ang
"Okay, I'm trying to work this backwards",s,s,dis
You don't understand anything I'm saying.,s,dag,dis
and figure out where we took a turn to the worst thing.,s,s,dis
Of course not.,ag,ag,dis
"Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards here and I'm trying to figure out the exact moment that you took a turn for the worst here, now.",s,s,dis
"you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine.",s,s,neu
"Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the ""the Grunions are running tonight,"" and I said ""okay great, let's go.""",s,s,neu
So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and--,s,s,neu
Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married.,s,s,neu
"And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",s,s,sad
"Wait a minute, I've got it.",c,c,neu
"It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said ""let's get some champagne"" and I said ""no time to wasting"" or something like that.  That's what it is, right?",q,q,neu
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,ans,ans,sad
"Oh right sure, of course.",ag,ag,neu
No.,ans,ans,sad
You want me to go get some champagne?,q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,sad
Do you want to take off our shoes?,q,q,neu
What? Huh?,q,q,neu
You want to get married again?,q,q,neu
What?  What?  You want to divorce?,q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,dis
A vacation?,q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,dis
"A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want?",q,q,ang
I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.,ans,ans,ang
"Well, welcome to the human race.",s,s,dis
You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No.,o,o,ang
"No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--",o,o,sad
No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this.,dag,s,sad
This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,s,s,ang
"Yeah, it is.",dag,dag,neu
"Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting.",o,o,ang
Right.,ag,ag,neu
This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.,o,o,sad
I know me neither.,ag,ag,sad
This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying?,q,q,sad
I'm doing the best I can.,ans,ans,sad
"I know that Augie, I really do.",ag,ag,sad
"I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else.",o,o,sad
Maybe if you were with somebody else too?,o,o,sad
I didn't say that.,dag,dag,sad
"No, I know but--I know I don't make you happy.",o,o,sad
Are you kidding me?  For heaven sake Augie anything I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.,o,o,sur
Yeah?,q,q,sad
"Yes, don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?",q,q,sur
"You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself.",o,ans,sad
Look what we got here.,s,s,hap
It's not champagne.,s,s,neu
I guess we don't need glasses.,s,s,hap
"Are you cold, huh?  Do you want to go home?",q,q,neu
I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this might be the spot after all.,ans,ans,hap
"Augie, I'm sorry.",ap,ap,sad
Shh...,oth,oth,hap
"If we are really quiet, the fish might come.",o,o,hap
Or not.,ag,o,neu

Good God.,s,s,fea

Freda is the only one who knows we are here. She wouldn't ring up.,s,s,fea

Right.  Well.  We still need it.,s,s,neu
No it doesn't say it on the form.,ans,ans,dis

It's lunch hour.,s,s,dis
Right.  It's the D.M.V..,ans,ag,dis
"I know, it gets long, but I can't do anything without your--do you have Social Security card, maybe?",q,q,dis
"Well, no.  I mean, I don't carry my original documents with me because if those things get destroyed, then what do you, you know what I mean, like if I loose my wallet or something, I'll never have them again.",ans,ans,dis
I have my passport and I have my driver's license. And that's all I have.,s,s,dis
"Alright, I don't know what to tell you right.",o,o,dis
"I think you're just gonna--you're gonna have to get 'em and then you can back and then, we'll help you out.  Maybe, we can-",s,s,dis

I can't.,ans,ans,dis
And I can give you my social--,s,s,dis

"No, it's--",dag,dag,dis
And I can tell you where I was born and what time and by who and what day.,s,s,dis

I can't go--I have to go back to work.  I don't have time to go back to my house and get all of that stuff and then get back in line and wait for another forty five minutes.,ans,ans,dis
"Well, the weekends are not as busy.  Maybe you can uh, come and try to get here early--",o,o,dis
"Um, I have kids.  I have to take them places on the weekends.  I don't have time to come back here.  Please.  I really need you to help me.",o,o,dis
I can't.  There's nothing I can do.  I'm sorry.,ap,ap,dis

"Ok, but you're right now you're holding up more people in line by standing here-- and letting",s,s,ang
"Well, why didn't the D.M.V. put that you needed your birth certificate on the application then?",q,q,ang
"I--when you're going to the D.M.V., you usually need pretty professional identification--",ans,ans,dis
"You know, Official documentation--",s,s,ang
"Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate?  Nobody does that.",o,o,ang
"No, but you come--you come to the D.M.V., it's something-- You should've- You should've figured--",dag,dag,dis
With your driver's license and your passport.  Just like everybody else.,s,s,ang
"But, without your drive--where-where- what about your identification without your driver's license?  I mean, you need--you needed something before then?",q,q,dis
"Who--you always use your driver's license.  I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway.",ans,ans,ang
"All right.  Well, um, you know, I'd love to help you, but--nothing I can do.",s,s,dis
"So, if you wanna go get your birth certificate, um, maybe come back--I don't--maybe you can talk to the person in the--in the front of line maybe.  I don't know.",o,o,dis
Do you have a supervisor?,q,q,dis
I am the supervisor.  So--,ans,ans,dis
"Well, thank you very much.  You've been very helpful.",g,g,dis
It's almost time for me to go.,s,s,sad

What--what're we gonna do here?  I can't--I can't do this by myself.  I--,q,q,dis

"But, I'm--I'm nothing--I'm nothing without you here.  Maybe we can--we can get out of this somehow.",o,o,dis
I don't think so.,dag,dag,sad
"Well, come on.  You've gotta think of something.  A year--a year away, it's gonna tear us apart.  I don't even--I don't even wanna think about it.  I mean, I don't even know if I'll be able to get in touch with you or--",o,o,dis
"Well, we can do the best we can and-and, with um, you know like wireless internet these days--I think that we could-- Talk every once in awhile.",o,o,sad
You could send me pictures.,o,o,sad
"What if--maybe--what if, uh, we went somewhere over there?  I don't--I don't know--I--I need to figure something out for this because--",q,q,dis
"Their not gonna let you.  You have to stay home and I have to go.  I mean, that's all--",ans,ans,sad
"and--I mean, my daughter--I don't want to put her in danger.  You know?  She has to stay.",o,o,sad
This is gonna be a--a crucial yet--she's--she's growing up.  She's gonna need you.,o,o,dis
But she's--you're not gonna--you're not gonna be here for--for her first words.  For her first steps.  I mean--it's something that you're supposed to be here for that--,o,o,sad
You can just remember it for me.,c,c,sad
I don't know--I don't know--I don't know how--I don't know how this could even be possible for you--I--if I was--,ans,dag,dis
"Well, I need--I need you to be able to do this for me 'cause I can't do anything about it.",o,o,sad
"I mean, it's just as hard for me, but--I know that we can do it, you know",o,o,sad
"I mean, you just get to--go off and do your thing.  I mean, yeah, we're both--I don't know--it's bad for both of us, but--",o,o,dis

I don't want you in danger.  And I don't want her in danger.,o,o,sad
I have no choice. There's nothing I can do.,o,o,sad
All right.,ag,ag,sad

"So, uh, so how's it been going?  I mean, you have any needs or anything?",q,q,neu
I'm--every lead that I get ends up just being a dead end.  You know what I mean.  People are sick of me calling--,ans,ans,dis
"No.  You can't think that way.  I mean it's good--it's good that you're--that you're calling, you know. you can't",o,o,neu
"Yeah, but it--I mean it's the same response you get over and over again.  Like--",s,s,dis
"Oh, we're not hiring at this time or thank you, we already have your information on file--We'll call you when we're ready.",s,s,dis
"But, it's been so long, like--I mine as well just take a job at McDonald's.  Like, I don't--",o,o,dis
"No, come on.  Don't [GARBAGE]",dag,dag,neu
"I just--I can't do it anymore.  Like, it just takes it out of you--",o,o,dis
"I know.  I know. It's hard, but you just--you gotta keep going.  I mean, you've been going at it for so long, you know.  Something is definitely going to come up.  I-I know it will, because you're a good worker--",o,o,neu
I just keep getting rejected.  I just keep getting rejected over and over and over again and it starts to make you feel like there must be something wrong with you that you can't get a job.,s,s,dis
"No.  It's--I mean, it's competitive, you know.  That's-That's what it is.  that's what you gotta be is competitive.",o,o,neu
"Yeah, but maybe--if just because it's competitive, like maybe I'm just not good enough.  Maybe the level is here and I'm here and there's just no way I'm ever gonna do that--",o,o,dis
"There...There are plenty of people out there with--with like, good jobs, you know, that are a lot...",s,s,neu
...dumber than you.  I mean they're a lot worse off than you.  You are much better off than like a lot of those people in there. I know,o,o,neu
"I didn't have like one of those starts, you know, like a family member who was already in the business or something you know that could like give me a helping hand.",s,s,dis
"I know.  It makes it harder.  I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases, but--",ag,ag,neu
"It's just so frustrating.  Like, I just--I just don't wanna do it anymore.  You know?  I just don't wanna like hit the pavement every single day with my resumes and going out there all the time.  You know, it's just like--",o,o,dis
"But you gotta.  Otherwise, what is--what's your other option?",q,q,neu
I feel so worthless.,o,o,sad
"It's not worthless 'cause it's definitely gonna--it's definitely gonna pay off.  I know it.  I mean, I can--I've just--I've seen your work etiquette.  You know, you're a good worker and...",dag,dag,neu
... and there's no reason that--that something won't come up like really soon.  All right?  So you just gotta--,o,o,neu
And what would make you say that?  There doesn't seem to be any indicators that anything's going to get better.,q,q,dis
"Because I know you.  You know, and maybe once you get to know some more people, like talking to them and everything, they'll get to know you too and they'll realize they should've hired you three years ago.  You know? but  And- and they'll finally come around and believe me--it'll--you gotta-",ans,ans,neu
"It's just really hard.  I feel like their starting to get like a personal prejudice against me.  You know what I mean?  Like it's like suddenly it starts to feel like it's just you that they say no to and it's not that they're not taking applications and it's not that they're not hiring people, it's just you particularly they have some particular reason for just hating you.  You know?",o,o,dis
"Well maybe yeah, but maybe you get to that point where it's like you bug 'em and then they just don't wanna hear from you anymore, but you keep bugging them and bugging them and then it's gonna annoy them so much that they're gonna be like all right fine. you know",o,o,neu
Or they'll never talk to me again.,o,o,dis
"Or, well, no.  Okay. you -[GARBAGE]",dag,dag,dis
"I-I just I think maybe I should try something else.  I mean, I-I don't know.  All growing up this is the only thing that I ever wanted to do and yet I can't.  I'm not physically able apparently.  I mean--",o,o,dis
"That obviously that's not true though.  I mean, you've done this before.  You've done all the work like this before, you know, and and you've gotten people saying oh, you're so good and like you know--",dag,dag,neu
"I guess the money shouldn't matter to me, but--Somehow it does.  You know? It's not like I do it for the money, but",o,o,dis
Right.,ag,b,neu
"Well, you've gotta live.",o,s,neu
"you have to--I mean, if you're hired by somebody, then you're not a professional, you're an amateur and that means that you're not good enough.",o,o,dis
"I mean, it's just, it's really--I don't know, yeah, it's about their opinions and it's about, I don't know, just getting yourself out there and--",s,s,neu
"I just wanna crawl in a hole, you know.  Like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning.",o,o,sad
"Well, come on, come on.  Thinking about it like this is definitely not gonna help either though.",o,o,neu
"Hi, um, excuse me, I believe that the airline lost my baggage.",s,s,neu
"Um, okay, it didn't--didn't come out on the carrousel--",q,q,neu
"No, it didn't. um It didn't come out and I don't see it anywhere around here, so what can you do about that?",q,q,neu
"Okay.  Um, well, unfortunately yeah there was a some- some problems with the--",ans,ans,neu
Some problems?  What is that supposed to mean?,q,q,sur
"Uh, well some-some of the bags were--were lost on the way over here. uh-",ans,ans,neu
How do you lose a suitcase?  A huge suitcase?,q,q,sur
"You know, I mean, there's a lot of things that go on under the plane and sometimes, you know, that kind of things happen.",ans,ans,neu
"Uh, But, we are willing to reimburse you for the bag and and for the contents--",s,s,neu
How much?,q,q,neu
"Um, we'd be willing to give you uh fifty dollars for--",ans,ans,neu
"Fifty dollars?  For my suitcase?  I mean, the suitcase itself was like a hundred and fifty dollar just for the suitcase, but all the things inside, all my clothes, all my personal belongings, the sentimental value, not to mention, which is more-more than all of that together.",s,s,sur
"Right.  Uh We realize, you know, that that it's a bad situation, but I'm sorry, there's nothing that we can really do.",ag,ag,neu
"That's all, that's all, that's all you're going to do is just give me fifty dollars and say go have fun on your vacation without any of your stuff?",q,q,ang
"I think, um, maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office--",s,s,neu
"Yes, yes, I would like to file a claim, but what are you gonna--I mean, is it just gonna show up magically out of nowhere?",q,q,dis
"Right.  No.  I mean they- they might--they might--if you-if you are argue the case more, maybe they'll reimburse you more, but, right now--",dag,dag,neu
"Yes, I know. I know-. It's It's frustrating.  Unfortunately though-- um",ag,ans,neu
"Because you don't seem to care very much, you know.",o,o,ang
"By checking your bags, you--you, you know- admit to the liability that's- that's at risk--",s,s,neu
I didn't sign anything.,s,s,dis
"Right, well, by checking in your bags, you agreed to, you know, at the will of the--",s,s,neu
"You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us.  So so, really, it's really the risk was taken and, I'm sorry, but there's really nothing else we can do.  So do you want--do you want the reimbursement?",s,s,neu
"[BREATHING] Well, sure, yeah, I guess I'll go buy dinner and then be--have nothing for the rest of my entire vacation.  I'm supposed to be here for three weeks.  What am I gonna do without anything for three weeks?",q,q,dis
"Well, there are-there are some shops here in- in the airport--",ans,ans,neu
But fifty dollars isn't going to get me anything.,s,s,dis
"No, um, like I said you can file a claim and, uh, maybe get reimbursed for more-- you",s,s,neu
Isn't there anything else you can do?,q,q,dis
probably even talk to--,s,s,neu
"I mean, is there somebody you can call?  Or the guy that put the stuff on the--on the plane.  I mean, are they--they must be really irresponsible to have just disappeared my baggage.  I mean, did it get stolen?",q,q,dis
"Right, that--that gets taken care of-- That gets taken care of.  We get we do, you know, we investigate those and just make sure that um- they're not doing their own thing with them so--uh",s,ans,neu
"Yeah, I'm sure you -- You're like, hmm, do you take baggage?  No.  Oh, okay, thanks.  Great.  I mean how--",s,s,dis
but Unfortunately sometimes is--,s,s,neu
"Well, that's--that's what I'm saying--",s,s,neu
There needs to be better security here.,o,o,dis
"Okay.  Well that that could be something that you put on on the claim--on on the complaint form if you want.  And provide us with your information while you're here and then, maybe, if it turns up, then we'll send it right over.",o,o,neu
It sounds like it's such a little like oh well no big deal whatever.  It's a big deal to me.,s,s,ang
"All right, Miss, I-I know.  I realize this. But Like I said, there are several people that are in your same situation, so, um, it's not--it's not totally uncommon and I'm actually gonna have to ask you to move so I can help the next person.",s,s,neu
"Well, can I at least have my fifty dollars, please?",c,c,dis
"Yes, all right.  There you go, now you can file a claim over to the left--And they'll help you out.",s,s,neu

He did a lot.  But--,s,s,sad
"I know.  It doesn't bring him back, but--",s,s,neu

I'm gonna forget him.,s,s,sad
"No, you'll never forget him.",dag,dag,neu
I won't be able to hear his voice or his--,s,s,sad

"...hang out and, like, have our different lives--And meet each other's friends and stuff.  So, I'm just so glad 'cause they have such a good school",s,s,hap
"Yeah, no, definitely--It's gonna..",ag,ag,hap

"and like-- The football team--And like all the-...you- what I mean, like...",s,s,hap
Yeah,ag,b,hap
Fight on.,s,s,hap
"You can walk somewhere and be anywhere in the country and be like, oh, yeah, I am at U.S.C.",ans,s,hap
"And you know what, you know what I mean, like it's recognizable rather than just being like I went some random school. It's like people really know what you...",o,s,hap
[LAUGHTER],oth,oth,hap
Wow. That's cool.,o,o,hap
"...like, they feel like--I feel like it's going to be so like accomplished.  Do you know what I mean?",q,q,hap
Like it has some prestige. so,s,s,hap
"Yeah, I mean there's all the money stuff and my mom's helping me with the financial aid and stuff.  But, it'll be fine--",ans,ans,hap
"Like, now that I'm accepted, it's just, like, such a huge load off my mind.",o,o,hap
I don't mind worrying about all the paperwork.  You know--,ans,s,hap
So...,oth,oth,neu
"Because, I don't have to like make that decision anymore.  I don't have to try and decide, like, what the bad school I'm going to go to is. you know",o,o,hap
"Right.  Right.  Right. Oh, man, then you're going to have to do orientation, I guess.",ag,ag,hap
"I know. I know.  I think you go and you like stay for a couple of days and you meet people and--And they'll give you like a tour--And show you everything.  Oh, man, I'm just so--I'm so excited.",s,s,hap
That'll be awesome.,o,o,hap
"I mean because you went to the campus before, right?",q,q,hap
"Yeah, oh totally.  It's a beautiful campus.  It's gonna be really nice.  Um, and everyone is friendly and like there's ivy on all the walls.  Oh, it's just so--it's so like collegiate.",ans,ans,hap
"You know what I mean?  Like, it's like exactly what I want.",q,o,hap
"Well, you know, I've thought about it but they have so many things that I might--Like try some things out first...",ans,ans,hap
"...because also on the list of their, um, like G.E.'s or whatever, you have a lot of choices within every single one.  So you can, like, try things out and not just be like, oh, I have to take math, oh, I have to take this.  You know what I mean?",q,s,hap
"So, um, so I don't know.",o,o,hap
I mean I'm gonna take a bunch of stuff and see.,s,s,hap
Oh man.,b,b,hap
"I- They have like--they just have so many like prestigious like this school is top ten and like the departments within it, you know what I mean.",s,s,hap
"I know, I get to be one of those now--I'll like walk around and be like a U.S.C..  You know what I mean.",ag,ag,hap
Ahh. Yeah. [GARBAGE],b,b,hap
"You'll be like are you a fan or a student you know? Student. [LAUGHTER] Oh man, that's awesome.",o,o,hap
And you'll be like...,b,b,hap
"Student. I'm a student. Yes I am, Thank you very much.",ans,g,hap
[BREATHING],oth,oth,hap
A U.S.C. graduate now. You're set.,s,s,hap
I know.  I'm excited.,ag,ag,hap
"Well, that'll take a while. [GARBAGE]",ans,s,hap
That's going to be a lot of work.,s,s,hap
"But, it'll be fine, I mean.  I'm so excited. It's going to be so fun.",o,o,hap
"I know, and I mean the area's not great, but like the school makes up for it. It'll be fine. It'll be good.",ag,o,hap
You're getting close to the beach.  I mean geez.,s,s,hap
I know. I know. So fun.  I can't wait.,o,s,hap
I will. I will. Thank you.,g,a,hap
Thanks.,g,g,hap
Ok.  I've- I've just been talking to this machine for the past half hour and I can't-can't get anything done.  I've been trying to book this vacation this entire time.,s,s,dis
"All right, sir.",a,a,neu
Okay.,ag,b,neu
"Um, how may I help you.  You're trying to book a specific flight?",q,q,neu
"Well, yeah, I mean I heard there was like these package deals and that maybe I could get a like a hotel or something like that. and-",s,s,dis
"Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You know, and especially because you've been waiting so long and I know that, um, you've been having a difficult time.",ag,ag,neu
"I want to definitely give you our special package today, which um is usually only for valued customers who have a record of having previous,",s,s,neu
"um lots of purchases, but we're gonna go ahead and give that to you anyway. uh,  Just to make sure that you're happy with your service here.",s,s,neu
You- You can do that--You can do that now? I don't have to get like transferred through or anything like that.,q,q,neu
Is that all right?,q,q,neu
"I can do that right now for you. No, absolutely.  I can take care of you all the way through to the end.",ans,ans,neu
All I'm going to need is your credit card number but just give me one moment. So-,s,s,neu
[BREATHING] that's good.,a,a,neu
"um, you're scheduling a flight as well--And you would like to, um, we have a highly discounted hotel rate that goes along with that so that everything is all in one deal.  You're taken care of by the time that you get there.",s,s,neu
"All right.  I want to make sure it's like a nice hotel--I mean-mean I'm gonna be paying a lot of money for this so I don't wanna-I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna to be a waste of time.",s,s,neu
Absolutely. we we,ag,ag,neu
"Yes, I completely understand.  Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above.  Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves.",s,s,neu
"So, you will absolutely be in a high rated great hotel and we can make sure that it's in a area of town that you like as well.",s,s,neu
Okay. So--,b,b,neu
Yeah.,ag,b,neu
"Well, you know, we wanted to--we wanted to go to Maui and--That was a",s,s,neu
Okay.,ag,b,neu
"--you know, the kids wanna go to the beach and stuff and so--um",s,s,neu
Great.  How many seats?,q,q,neu
"Well, it's gonna be four of them.",ans,ans,neu
Okay.  Great.  Four seats.  I'll book you for four seats.,a,a,neu
All right.  And can they like all get together?,q,q,neu
"Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Um- Would you like window seats or aisles?",q,q,neu
"Um- You know, window is nice. I guess",ans,ans,neu
"Okay, I can do um- a win- -two like a window and a aisle and a window and an aisle next to each other so that each of you can sit two by two. And switch around maybe?",q,q,neu
Okay.  Great.  What time of the day would you like?,q,q,neu
"Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know--",ans,ans,neu
All right.  Great.  Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that.,s,s,neu
"So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui.",s,s,neu
"And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel.",q,q,neu
Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare.,ans,ans,neu
And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel.,s,s,neu
Yeah--I completely understand.  It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible.,ag,ag,neu
All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right.,q,q,neu
Absolutely. Thank you so much for calling and we hope that you will come to us again.,ans,ans,neu
Okay.,ag,ag,neu
Thank you.,g,g,neu
Did you talk to him?,q,q,sad
He cried hard?,q,q,sad
What was he doing out here at that hour?,q,q,sad
What do you want to do argue with him?,q,q,dis
Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now?,q,q,ang
You can't say that to him.,ans,ans,dis
We've got to say it to him.,c,c,dis
Can you prove it?  How can you prove it?,q,q,dis
"For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.",ans,ans,ang
"To you it is and to me, but not to him.  I mean, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but he--there's no body and no grave so where are you?",q,q,dis
All right.  All right.  Listen to me.  You know why I brought Annie here don't you?,q,q,dis
"I've got an idea, but what's the story?",q,q,sad
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, that's only your business, Chris.",o,o,neu
You know it's not only my business.,dag,dag,dis
What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,o,o,ang
So it's all right then?,q,q,dis
I'll go ahead with it?,q,q,dis
"Well, then it isn't just my business--",s,s,ang
I'm just saying that--,s,s,neu
She's not Larry's girl.,dag,dag,ang
"From your father's point of view, he isn't dead.  And you've no right to take his girl.",s,s,dis
"And you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?",q,q,dis
"I don't know why, but, every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer.  My whole bloody life.  Time after time after time.",o,o,dis
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.,o,o,neu
To hell with that.,dag,dag,ang
[BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet?,q,q,neu
"Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.",q,q,neu
"Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",ans,ans,sad
"Trouble is, you don't see enough women.",o,o,sad
You never did.,s,s,dis
I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,s,s,dis
Because it is.,s,s,neu
"Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.  I mean, you've been away for--at war.  It's been five years.",s,s,dis
"These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",q,q,dis
"I don't want a diagram.  Umm-- He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.",ans,ans,dis
"I mean, what's gonna happen to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.",q,q,dis
"All right.  All right, then, Mom.",a,a,dis
I just--give it some more thought.,c,c,dis
I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,o,s,dis
What the hell is this?,q,q,sur
Are you crazy?,q,q,ang
I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.,ans,ans,ang
What about the business?  What the hell is this?,q,q,ang
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ans,ans,ang
Must you be inspired?,q,q,ang
"Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.",ans,ans,ang
"Yes, on this I would.",ans,ans,neu
"Well, you don't want to think like that.",c,o,ang
"I know.  I know, Mom.  Just help me stay here.",ag,ag,dis
"All right.  Just-- just don't go thinkin' that way, you hear me?",q,q,dis
I am thinkin' that way.,ans,ans,neu
"I don't understand you, do I?",q,q,dis
"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",ans,ans,neu
I can see that.,ag,s,sad
"Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.",ans,ans,neu
What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again?,q,q,neu
How do you know he's even thinking of it?,q,q,neu
-he's not gonna marry her.,c,c,dis
It's got that all about it.,ans,ans,ang
"Well, so what?",q,q,neu
"Now, listen Kate.",c,c,neu
You can't read her mind.,o,o,neu
"Well then why is she still single?  I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited.",o,o,dis
How do you know why she's waited?,q,q,neu
"She knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",ans,ans,dis
"Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?",q,q,dis
"Well, what do you want me to do about it?",q,q,dis
I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.,ans,ans,dis
But Kate--,b,b,dis
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but...",o,o,ang
But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.,s,s,ang
Calm yourself.,c,c,dis
"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone.",s,s,dis
Calm yourself.,c,c,dis
"Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  I mean, you read it yourself.",s,s,dis
All right.  All right.  Calm yourself.,c,c,dis
"You, above all, have to believe.",c,c,dis
Just--just don't stop believing.,ans,ans,dis
What does that mean?  Me above all?,q,q,ang
Look at you.  Look at you shaking.,s,s,ang
I can't help it.,o,o,dis
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?,q,q,ang
"from her point of view, why else would I come?",o,q,sad
"You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.",o,o,hap
I almost got married two years ago.,ans,ans,hap
You started to write me and--,ans,ans,hap
Every day since.,ans,ans,hap
I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,s,o,hap
No.  Nothing like that.,ans,ans,sad
"Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",q,q,sad
"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",ans,ans,sad
You've gotta tell me.,c,c,sad
I don't know how to start.,s,s,sad
It wouldn't work this way.,s,s,sad
"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",q,q,sad
"Yeah, sure.",ans,ans,sad
"Well, I lost them.",s,s,sad
How many?,q,q,sad
Just about all.,ans,ans,sad
"Oh, gee.",b,b,sad
It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.,o,o,sad
"For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",s,s,sad
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",o,o,sad
"I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.",o,o,sad
"You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",o,o,sad
Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.,s,s,sad
"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",s,s,sad
"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",o,o,sad
Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.,o,o,sad
You still feel that way?,q,q,sad
What'll I do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.,q,q,hap
"This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better.",o,o,hap
"I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.",o,o,hap
How you doing?,q,q,hap
Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell.,s,s,hap
"Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think?",q,q,hap
"How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.",s,s,hap
What flashlight?,q,q,neu
"Oh, well sure.",ag,ag,neu
"Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally.",ag,ag,neu
"I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember?",q,q,neu
Yeah.,ag,ans,neu
"You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh, we should've brought the blanket.  Our blanket.",s,s,neu
"This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now.",s,s,hap
I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.,o,o,hap
You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,q,q,hap
Do you want my jacket?,q,q,neu
"It's after eleven, let's just go home.",s,s,dis
Right.,ag,b,neu
That's my point too.,ag,ag,neu
No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?,dag,dag,neu
"Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.",s,s,hap
"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die.",s,s,dis
"Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,",s,s,hap
this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.,o,o,hap
"What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.",o,o,dis
Yeah they do.,dag,dag,dis
"Ah, Augie.",b,b,dis
Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.,s,s,hap
I'm just not.,s,s,dis
"I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life.",s,s,neu
"Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions.",s,s,dis
We weren't in a good spot.,o,o,neu
We didn't see them the first time either.,s,s,neu
There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?,q,q,hap
"Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this.",c,c,hap
"all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters.",s,s,hap
It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name.,o,o,hap
"They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.",s,s,hap
"Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up.",s,s,hap
"Well, so what do you think?",q,q,neu
About what?,q,q,neu
What I was saying.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, so what do you think?",q,q,hap
About what?,q,q,neu
What I was saying.,ans,ans,neu
It's ridiculous.,o,o,dis
It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,dag,dag,neu
"Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.",dag,dag,neu
"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?",q,q,neu
"God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.",ans,ans,ang
"Well, what's bugging you?",q,q,dis
We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.,ans,ans,ang
"There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home.",s,s,neu
"For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions.",o,o,dis
Why not?,q,q,dis
"We never do, do we?  I mean, have we ever?",q,q,dis
We've missed them twice.  That's not ever.,ans,ans,neu
Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.,s,s,dis
"Well, we'll see them this year.",o,o,neu
"No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.",dag,dag,dis
"I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.",o,o,ang
I thought you wanted to see it.,o,o,dis
You don't understand anything I'm saying.,s,s,dis
"No, of course not.",dag,dag,dis
I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is.,o,o,dis
It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about.,o,o,neu
"All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst.",s,s,dis
"You said, ""Hey the grunion are running tonight.""  I said, ""Great, let's go.  I feel lucky.""",s,s,neu
"Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--",s,s,neu
"Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married.",s,s,sad
"I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",s,s,sad
"And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.",s,s,sad
"And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",s,s,sad
Wait a minute.  I've got it.,c,c,neu
"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",s,s,sad
"It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, ""let's get some champagne,"" and I said, ""time's a wasting"" or something like that, right?",q,q,neu
"Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right?",q,q,neu
I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.,ans,ans,sad
"Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance?",q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,sad
You want me to go get some champagne?,q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,sad
Take off our shoes?,q,q,neu
"Well, what?  You want me to breathe in your ear?",q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,sad
You wanna get married again?,q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,dis
What?  What?  You want a divorce?,q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,dis
A vacation?,q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,dis
"A new carpet?  A poodle?  Ice cream?  Back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What?  Carla, what the hell do you want?",q,q,dis
"Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?",q,q,ang
"No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us",o,o,sad
"cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",s,s,dis
"Yes, it is.",dag,dag,neu
Right.,ag,ag,neu
Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,o,o,sad
"I know, me neither.",ag,ag,sad
I'm doing the best I can.,ans,ans,sad
"I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.",ag,ag,sad
"I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",o,o,sad
Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,o,o,sad
I didn't say that.,dag,dag,sad
"No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.",ag,ag,sad
Yeah?,q,q,sur
You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.,o,o,sad
"I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here.",o,o,hap
"Well, look what we have here.",s,s,hap
"Augie, you brought refreshments.",s,s,hap
It's not champagne.,s,s,hap
"Well, then we don't need glasses.",s,s,hap
No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all.,ans,ans,hap
"Augie, I'm sorry.",ap,ap,sad
Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.,o,o,hap
Or not.,ag,o,hap
Or not.,ag,ag,hap
Do you think it's them?,q,q,fea
I wonder.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, nobody know we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",s,s,fea
What're we gonna do?,q,q,fea
I don't care then.,s,s,neu
Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.,s,s,neu
"Ah, it send shivers up my spine.",s,s,hap
Behave exquisitely.,ans,ans,hap
With the most perfect poise?,q,q,neu
"Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy.",ans,ans,hap
Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?,q,q,neu
What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,ans,ans,hap
"Oh, darling, don't say that.",c,c,neu
It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.,o,o,hap
"Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",q,q,neu
"Yes, meaning just that.",ans,ans,hap
"You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want.",o,o,neu
Who's they?,q,q,neu
All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.,ans,ans,neu
Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,o,o,neu
"If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.",o,o,neu
"Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright.",ag,ag,neu
"Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours.",q,q,neu
Who knows.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?",q,q,neu
"No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion.",ans,ans,neu
"Oh, dear, shall we like that?",q,q,neu
Depends on how well we've played.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh?",q,q,neu
Yes.  Yes. With all his might.,ans,ans,hap
"No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.",ans,ans,hap
"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",o,o,hap
So is everyone else in the long run.,o,o,neu
"Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment.",o,o,hap
"Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",o,o,hap
"Elliott, worms don't pop.",s,s,hap
"I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best.",o,o,neu
"Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",o,o,hap
You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,q,q,neu
Which particular one?,q,q,hap
The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.,ans,ans,neu
Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully.,s,s,hap
"Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.",ag,ag,hap
How long did that row last?,q,q,neu
It went in intermittently for days.,ans,ans,hap
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.,s,s,neu
It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,s,s,hap
That was the first time you ever hit me.,ans,ans,neu
I didn't hit you very hard.,o,o,neu
"The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.",s,s,hap
"Oh, I'll never forget his face.",s,s,hap
It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.,o,o,hap
We were very much younger then.,s,s,neu
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",s,s,neu
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,s,s,neu
What of it?,b,b,ang
"Well, what about me?",q,q,ang
"Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",ans,ans,neu
"Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy?",q,q,neu
No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.,s,s,neu
Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,o,o,neu
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.,o,o,dis
"Well, it's become a habit with you.",o,o,neu
"You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.",o,o,ang
Don't be so stupid.,o,o,ang
What?,q,q,ang
Nothing.,ans,ans,dis
"A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?",o,o,hap
"No, it isn't.",dag,dag,dis
"Yes, it is.",dag,dag,dis
"Oh, be quiet.",c,c,ang
Doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,o,o,dis
"Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",o,o,dis
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",dag,dag,ang
Nonsense.  They have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,dag,dag,dis
They snap.,dag,dag,dis
"I don't care, do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.",o,o,dis
Mind your own business.,c,c,dis
You're quite insufferable,o,o,ang
I'm not in the least drunk.,dag,dag,ang
"On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",o,o,dis
"Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of four?  A child of six?  Or a child of nine?",q,q,dis
Shut up.,c,c,ang
"We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think?  Intemperate tots.",o,o,ang
"Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.",o,o,dis
Why?,q,q,ang
Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs.,ans,ans,dis
There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,s,s,dis
There are people downstairs I suppose?,q,q,dis
This is no time of the year for Tunis.,o,o,dis
"Turn it on again, please.",c,c,ang
I'll do no such thing.,dag,dag,ang
"Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.",dag,dag,ang
Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,c,c,ang
You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,o,o,ang
Turn it off.,c,c,ang
Stop it.  Go away.  I hate you.,c,c,ang
"Amanda, listen. listen",c,c,ang
"Listen?  Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.",o,o,ang
"Very amusing, indeed.",dag,dag,dis
"I hate you.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I hate you, do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",o,o,ang
"You're a vile, tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope to never see you again as long as I live.",o,o,ang
This is the end.  Finally and forever.  Do you hear me?  The end.,s,s,ang
You're not going like this.,c,c,ang
"Oh Yes, I am.",dag,dag,ang
You're not.,dag,dag,ang
I am.  Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you.,o,o,ang
Shut up. Shut up.,c,c,ang
I wouldn't-- I wouldn't marry--,s,s,ang
I wouldn't marry you if you came in crawling on your knees,s,o,ang
Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it.,o,o,ang
You're a evil vampire and I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.,o,o,ang
All right. Finally. Here you go.,s,s,dis
"Hi, How can I help you?",g,g,neu
"Yea. I just want to get this done,",ans,s,neu
"Sure, um",ag,a,neu
get my new license.,s,s,neu
do you have two forms of ID with you?,q,q,neu
"Um, no, I got my driver's license though.",ans,ans,neu
"I actually need two forms of ID. I need either a passport or a birth certificate, or social security card. I'm sorry.",s,s,neu
"Uh, sorry, I forgot them. I mean I've got to -",ap,ap,neu
Well,b,b,neu
well is the dri-driver's license going to work?,q,q,neu
I- I can take your driver's license but I need another form of ID in order to process this paper work.,s,s,neu
"Okay, so what are you saying? What-",q,q,dis
"Um, that you would need to go home and get another form of ID and come back.",ans,ans,neu
"What? I- You telling me I waited in that huge line to go and sit down and get my number called, like after",s,s,ang
"Well, I'm sorry sir but",ap,ap,dis
three hours and,s,s,ang
you need to bring two forms of ID there is nothing we can do about it.,s,s,dis
Shouldn't they have like told us about that? I mean why - why would they make me go and wait three hours if I have got to go and do it again?,q,q,ang
"Well, it's actually-",s,s,dis
"It's standard that you bring a couple of forms of ID, I'm sorry.",ans,s,dis
"It's standard? I mean I don't work at the D.M.V. how am I supposed to know that, like, I stand in line, I get my",q,q,ang
"Well, I'm sorry, sir, but we're not responsible.",ap,ap,dis
"I filled out the application right, didn't I?",q,q,ang
"Yes, you did, thank you very much, but we're not responsible if you've forgotten something, and we need to have two forms of ID.",ans,ans,dis
Okay. What about - no -- how about you hold that and I'll - I'll go and I can come back-,q,q,dis
"I'm sorry, but there is a lot of people waiting so you're just going to have to get in line again.",ap,ap,dis
I've been waiting for three hours.,s,s,dis
"It just happens to people all the time, I'm sorry sir, but I can't make an exception for you.",s,s,dis
This is ridiculous. Come on,o,o,dis
"I'm sorry, sir.",ap,ap,neu
"I cannot go back in that line. I've got stuff I need to do, I mean-",s,s,dis
there is nothing I can do.,s,s,neu
"I know sir, but we have to have two forms. There is nothing I can do about it, I'm sorry.",s,s,dis
That doesn't make any sense. Why?,q,q,dis
"I'm sorry, sir. There is nothing I can do.",ap,ap,dis
You- shouldn't you have like a sign or something maybe like up on the counter when you get the applica- maybe on the application,s,s,ang
"Well, if you had checked the web site it would have said.",ans,s,dis
If you had checked the website it would have said that you needed two forms of identification.,s,s,dis
"What web- I didn't go to a website - why would I need to - it's the D.M.V.. You come to the D.M.V., you wait in line for three hours, and then you go home.",ans,s,ang
"Well, maybe you should",o,o,dis
I waited in line now I'm ready to get my stuff and then go home.,s,s,dis
Right. So maybe you should go home now and get your paperwork and come back.,o,s,dis
"I'm sorry sir but there's a lot of people waiting. So if you won't move out of the way, then I'm going to have to call security.",ap,ap,dis
"God, oh my-",b,b,dis
This is ridiculous.,o,o,dis
"I'm sorry, sir, it's not my choice.",ap,ap,dis
"I'm going to miss you too; I don't know what I'm going to do here without you. It's going to be so lonely, and so hard.",o,o,sad
I don't want to be a single mom.,o,o,sad
"You won't be. I'll be back; I'll be back before you know it. All right, and",dag,dag,sad
but,b,b,sad
and,b,b,sad
It's dangerous; I mean how can you make sure that you'll,o,o,sad
"It's- It's dangerous anywhere, honey. I mean this is -this- I'm just going to go and we'll get it over with,",s,s,dis
I hope so.,o,o,sad
I hope so.,o,o,sad
It's going to be really rough.,o,o,sad
"You gotta take care of our baby for me, alright?",s,s,sad
I'll send you lots of pictures.,s,s,sad
"I hope so, because I'm not going to be able to survive without all that. I don't know what I'm going to do.",o,o,sad
I've never been - I've never been away from you for two weeks let alone a year.,s,s,sad
"Well, just promise me that you going to be safe.",c,s,sad
"I mean can't they put you in like, you know kitchen work or something where you won't get",q,q,sad
It doesn't make any sense; I don't know why we have to be at war in the first place.,o,o,dis
there's people that thought it was the right thing to do so now we have to- we have to do what we have to do for our country,s,s,sad
"and it'll work out you know, go there and do that. Yeah, I'll be back",s,s,neu
"Will you write me letters, paper ones?",q,q,sad
"Our baby needs a dad; you can't leave. Okay, you can't disappear.",o,o,sad
"Our baby has a dad, alright. Daddy is going to be back soon.",ag,ag,sad
"I want you to, you know, take lots of video; pictures and I can see you when I get back or while I'm there. I'm going to miss you.",s,s,sad
I'll miss you too.,o,o,sad
"Oh, you're never going to believe it.",o,o,hap
What? What? You look really happy what's going on?,q,q,hap
"Well, I finally did it",ans,ans,hap
Finally did what?,q,q,hap
"Oh, my Gosh. Well, and did",b,b,hap
Did she say yes?,q,q,hap
"Yes, she said yes. [LAUGHTER] I know",ans,ans,hap
That's like the most definitive.,o,o,hap
I would have thought you would have told me that you were planning on doing this.,o,o,hap
"Yea, I guess so. Oh, my Gosh. Was she surprised?",q,q,hap
"Yes, yes. You know, she - she was like - I mean, she was happy, you know",ans,ans,hap
"I - I think it was about time, I don't know, maybe. You know what, it's been it's been long enough now.",o,o,hap
"Oh, well, it was -- you know, we were at this- at this concert and yeah",ans,ans,hap
so I-I talked to some of the crew before hand and-,s,s,hap
"Oh, You did not.",dag,a,hap
I-I did.,s,s,hap
"Oh, my Gosh. that's so cute",o,o,hap
"That's so romantic. Oh, my Gosh. She must have died. That's like one of those things you write into a magazine about like my boyfriend did this. Oh my God.",o,o,hap
"I know, so",ag,ag,hap
I got to freak her out.,s,s,hap
"No, yes -- so",ans,b,hap
She must have flipped out.,q,q,hap
"Yea, that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no.",ans,ans,hap
Right exactly because you can't say no in front of thousands of people. [LAUGHTER],ag,ag,hap
"No, but it was good.",o,o,hap
Did you bring her up on stage too?,q,q,hap
"Yes, yes. [LAUGHTER]",ans,ans,hap
"Oh, my Gosh, that's so cute.",o,o,hap
"I know it was, I don't know I was really nervous but I'm really - I'm really glad.",o,o,hap
Are your parents excited or...?,q,q,hap
"Oh yes, they - they you know they love her and so I mean...",ans,ans,hap
"Ooh, that would be fun.",o,o,hap
"Yea, yea, I'm not too sure where yet I guess you know, I kind of got to figure some stuff out here first",ans,ans,hap
"Oh my Gosh. I cannot believe you're getting married, that is so cool.",o,o,hap
I know.,ag,ag,hap
"Golly, it just makes me all like romantic inside, like I really want that to happen to me. [LAUGHTER]",o,o,hap
"Oh, it will, obviously you know. But I know it's something - I don't know, you never really think about it happening, like before hand.",ag,ag,hap
"Sure. Oh, yes.",ag,ans,hap
"Yes, well, Thanks, thanks. Thank you. yeah",g,g,hap
"Yay, well congratulations, that's so cool. [BREATHING] I can't wait.",a,a,hap
Hah.,oth,oth,hap
I don't know what I'm going to do about this; I mean,ans,ans,dis
"I have got to get a job, you know? Like-",o,s,dis
"You've been doing a lot of work for it, right?",q,q,neu
"Well, yea you know, I get my resumes and I mean I-",ans,ans,dis
"Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is -",o,o,neu
"I go out all the places I can, every place that'll give an interview you know.",s,s,dis
"you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can.",o,o,neu
"But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, or",o,o,dis
"Well, but you care about what you do, right?",q,q,neu
"I don't know, I mean why - why",q,q,dis
"Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know.",o,ans,dis
"I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh",o,o,neu
"I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know.",o,o,dis
"Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself.",o,o,neu
"Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else.",ans,o,dis
You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's,o,o,neu
"I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table.",dag,dag,dis
"Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time.",o,o,neu
"I mean, maybe I'm not, you know. I don't have a job. Maybe - maybe I'm not as good as-as I thought I was and",o,o,dis
I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and,s,s,dis
I'm sorry.,ap,ap,sad
"I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking",s,s,sad
"maybe - maybe take up painting, I don't know, you know.",o,o,dis
"Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know.",o,o,dis
Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.,o,o,dis
"That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like",o,o,neu
"and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.",o,o,neu
So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.,o,o,neu
"I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn't",o,o,dis
this doesn't happen to a normal person.,o,o,ang
"You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.",o,o,neu
"But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.",o,o,neu
"I mean, I don't know, I don't see - I don't see any other way - any other way around it right now.",s,s,dis
"Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop.",o,o,neu
Right. Thanks for talking to me.,a,a,sad
It seems that uh- my-my bag didn't make it out on the carousel.,o,s,neu
"Oh, did you check? Did you make sure as it went around the second time that it-",q,q,neu
"Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so-",s,s,neu
Okay. So what-what do I have to get you know,q,q,neu
"Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-",s,ans,neu
"For some reason, so you think it won't show up?",q,q,sur
"Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that",s,ans,neu
Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.,s,s,neu
"Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something.",ans,ans,neu
I really - I really need that bag.,s,s,dis
"I- I- I understand, but um.",ag,ag,neu
Okay,ag,ag,neu
"I mean -- I've been away for a while and- and now I've- I've gifts for- for you know friends and family I mean, I got stuff in the there",s,s,dis
Right.,ag,b,neu
"I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-",s,s,neu
"Not going to show - well isn't like - wouldn't it just be at the airport, that, like, if it didn't get on the other plane",o,q,dis
can they check there?,q,q,dis
"Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and",s,ans,neu
"they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that.",s,s,neu
So we'll- what we'll do,s,s,neu
"But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and",o,o,ang
see where it came from originally. I mean it seems like-,o,o,dis
Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you.,ag,ag,neu
"Um, so.",b,b,neu
"Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with-",q,q,ang
"We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know",ans,ans,neu
I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage.,ap,ap,neu
This is unbelievable. I've got,o,o,dis
you don't realize the stuff that I've got in that - I really need to get the suitcase okay,s,s,ang
"I understand, so-",ag,ag,neu
"so if it's back there or something, if there is something you can do",c,c,dis
"I need you to tell me because I really need to get the bag, okay?",o,c,dis
"all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage",s,s,neu
and we will continue to look for it and because your paper-,s,s,neu
You've already checked? Can you check again? [garbage],q,q,dis
"I've already looked, thank you very much and because we've filled out paperwork if it shows up we will send it to you but otherwise what we can do is reimburse you for fifty dollar.",s,s,dis
"Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-",s,s,neu
"Uh huh, yea, lost some of my possessions, yes, so if I lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carry-on",s,s,dis
"that might be like fifty dollars okay, but this - I- [garbage] I had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase.",s,s,dis
The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-,s,s,neu
The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean-,q,q,ang
Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have,ans,ans,neu
"we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-",s,s,neu
I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do,q,q,ang
because this is ridiculous?,o,o,dis
I don't believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh- in which we can reimburse you and that's all we can do and I'm sorry I've done everything I can-,s,s,dis
All right. I'm sick- I'm sick of this all right. I'm sick of you and keep your fifty dollar.,o,o,dis
There's other people waiting-,s,s,dis
"Oh my God. Oh my God, I'm so sorry.",ap,ap,sur

Totally.,ag,ag,sad

Yeah,ag,b,sad
"not being able to see anyone again, who knows where they really went, you know. I mean, I guess we can just hope that wherever they are now if it's anywhere that it's better I mean.",o,o,sad
"Yes. Well, at least you have a lot of good memories.",o,ag,sad
She was [garbage],s,s,sad
"She really cared about you, you know.",o,o,sad
"Yes, I mean she cared about all of us. She was great",ans,o,sad

Yes.  [BREATHING] God.,ag,ag,sad
Are you going to be okay?,q,q,sad
"I just -- I just don't get it, like there is just nothing you can do about it you know, it's like just out of your control and it",o,ans,sad
"just makes it that much harder to deal 'cause as much as you want to, you know, make her better, see her not in any pain, it's like, just I don't know, just has a mind of its own.",o,o,sad
Then she's gone.,s,s,sad
"It's going to be okay, I promise.",o,o,sad
"Well, you know I appreciate you coming over and talking to me, I mean it definitely helps",o,a,sad
Sure,ag,ag,sad

All right. Customer service this is Steve.,s,s,neu

"Okay. Before I get into it, um your menu or whatever like where you choose the different thing depending on the-",s,s,hap
"it leads you around in circles, you can't, there is no way to like get to a real person if you don't already know how to get to there.",s,s,hap
"Right. No, yes I know. It is-It is a little frustrating.",ag,ag,neu
"So is there any way to like bypass that because that is so, like I've been going around in circles",q,q,dis
"like press nine, press zero, press back to the menu, like I can't get through to what I'm supposed to get through to.",s,s,dis
"pretend like your on a rotary phone, goes straight through to a person.",s,s,neu
"Okay. Oh, that would just make it so much better, 'cause I cannot handle it's just like oh, my God I can't sit here any longer and talk to this lady with this pleasant voice.",o,o,dis
I know they don't tell you that kind of thing.,ag,ag,neu
"Sorry. Okay. Um-, yes",ap,ap,neu
"Thank you very much. Um  So I have a charge on my credit card that, um, isn't mine.",s,s,neu
"Uh, I don't know where it came from and it's actually quite large, and I don't have the money for it so",s,s,neu
it really freaks me out when I got my bill because it was like I don't -- I didn't spend this. This is not my charge.,s,s,dis
"Yea. All right. Well, let me-let me look it up here for a second. Uh, so i think",s,s,neu
"Okay, it was um- at the [GARBAGE] sorry, it was at a department store, I think it was Macy's or something",ans,s,neu
"Okay, Alright, yeah. I- I see it on here.",ag,ag,neu
"and it was like something like eight hundred dollars. I don't remember. It was just a lot and I have thing in front of me right now, but-",s,s,dis
"All right. Well, you know that's, that's what we have all of our protection plans for and everything like that so I mean it's",s,s,neu
it- it'll work out fine.,o,ans,neu
"Yes, we'll get- we'll get rid of it right now. I mean just we're going to have to have you, um, submit something you know, we're going to have to have you mail something in for us, okay.",s,s,neu
"So- So you can um find that application. You have the Internet, you can go to our website.",s,s,neu
Yeah. Yeah. You get the form right now. and- yeah,ans,ans,neu
"We could mail it to you as well, but-",s,s,neu
"Right. You can go online, print it out, and just fill out the form and um- send it to us um- you know,  regarding the grievance and-",s,s,neu
and it'll get taken off um- no problem you know,s,s,neu
Cause I-I just don't know how someone could have gotten my charge information,s,s,dis
Right. I mean we might,ag,b,neu
Okay.,ag,b,neu
So is there any- I mean what if they spend something again?,q,q,fea
"Uh, I mean have you been shopping around on the Internet and stuff? I mean that you gave-",q,q,neu
I did buy one thing on ebay I don't know that might-,ans,ans,neu
"Uh-ha, I mean usually sites are pretty well protected but sometimes I mean information gets out, so",s,s,neu
so it is a little a little hard in that situation if you want -- you know you can -um- we can- we can issue another credit card.,o,o,neu
"Oh, really?",q,q,sur
"Yeah, yeah. Maybe we'll, uh-",ans,ans,neu
it's a different number and everything,ans,s,neu
Yeah. yeah.,ag,ag,neu
"Yes, um but  for- for that- for that charge we will need you to send something in but we can get you processed immediately for this, for this, for this new card. It still goes to the same address, right?",s,s,neu
Okay. All right. Then we'll get it sent out there. And,s,s,neu
Great.,a,a,hap
And you know just I mean be careful in the future if um,s,s,neu
Yeah.,ag,b,hap
if you're ever online or anything like that I mean just make sure it's a secure site and,s,s,neu
"and never you know, give it to anyone out, never even give out your number to any like unreliable company that you haven't heard of or anything like that, all right? Because, um, we want to- we definitely want to help you out, but-",s,s,neu
"Right, right.",ag,ag,neu
"Okay, great.",a,a,neu
"Yeah, totally.",ag,ag,neu
you know it gets- it gets difficult you know so Alright.,o,o,neu
Well thank you so much. You've been very helpful. I really appreciate it.,o,o,hap
"Alright Yes, I'm sorry for all the inconvenience but we'll get it taken care of.",ap,ap,neu
Thank you very much bye.,g,g,hap
I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.,ans,ans,sad
No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.,ans,ans,sad
I could hear him right through the floor in my room.,ans,ans,sad
You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,ans,ans,dis
"What do you want to do, argue with him?",q,q,dis
"No I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore.",ans,ans,dis
"Why -- why shouldn't he dream of him? Walk around, waiting for him at night I mean do we contradict him, do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore that we haven't had hope for years now?",q,q,dis
You can't say that to him.,ans,ans,dis
We've got to say it to him.,c,dag,ang
"Can you prove it, how can you prove it?",q,q,dis
"For God sakes it's been three years, nobody comes back after three years, that's insane.",ans,ans,ang
To you it is and to me. You can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you?,q,q,dis
All right. All right. Listen to me.,c,c,dis
You know why I brought Annie here don't you?,q,q,neu
You know.,ans,ans,neu
I got an idea but what's the story?,q,q,neu
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,ans,ans,neu
No it's not only my business.,dag,dag,dis
What do you want me to do; you're old enough to know your own mind.,q,q,dis
So it's all right then I'll go ahead with it?,s,q,dis
"Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't-",s,s,neu
See it isn't just my business-,s,s,ang
I'm just saying,s,s,dis
She's not Larry's girl.,dag,dag,dis
From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.,s,s,neu
"You can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go, see I don't know. So what can I do for you?",q,q,dis
"I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.",o,o,ang
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.,o,o,neu
To hell with that.,dag,dag,ang
Have you asked Annie yet?,q,q,dis
I wanted to get this settled first.,ans,ans,neu
How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.,q,q,neu
"Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.",ans,ans,neu
"I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.",c,c,sad
"Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.",o,o,ang
So what I'm not fast with women.,s,s,dis
I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,s,q,ang
Because it is.,s,ans,dis
That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. I mean you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's five years.,s,s,dis
"I can't help it I know her best. I mean lived next door to her my whole life. These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.",o,o,dis
"I don't want a diagram. He thinks he's coming back. Chris, you marry this girl you're pronouncing him dead.",ans,ans,dis
"Do you know what's going to happen to your father because I don't, see?",q,q,dis
"If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out.",s,o,sad
What the hell is this?,q,q,ang
"I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York.",ans,ans,sad
"What the hell is this, are you crazy?",q,q,ang
"I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.",ans,ans,ang
What about the business? What is this?,q,q,ang
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ans,ans,ang
Must you be inspired?,q,q,ang
"Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.",ans,ans,ang
"Tell me, you'd leave the business?",q,q,ang
"Yes, on this I would.",ans,ans,sad
"Well, you don't want to think like that.",c,o,ang
Then help me stay here.,c,c,dis
I know I know mom. All right. Just help me stay here.,ag,ag,dis
Just don't go thinking that way.,c,c,dis
"Well, I am thinking that way.",ans,dag,dis
"I don't understand you, do I?",q,q,dis
"Yea, I can see that.",ag,ag,sad
Why did he invite her here?,q,q,ang
She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden-,ans,ans,ang
"Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.",ans,o,neu
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,o,o,ang
"What do you mean? He lived next door to the girl all his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?",q,q,dis
"Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.",c,s,dis
He's not going to marry her.,c,c,ang
How do you know he's even thinking of it?,q,q,neu
"Well, so what?",q,q,neu
What's going on here Joe?,q,q,ang
-She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not.,s,s,ang
You can't read her mind.,o,o,neu
"Then why is she still single, I mean New York is full of men, why isn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy but she's waited.",o,o,dis
How do you know why she has waited?,q,q,dis
"She knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",ans,ans,dis
"Look it's a nice day, what are we arguing for?",q,q,dis
"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away Joe. Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",ans,ans,dis
What do you want me to do about it?,q,q,dis
"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense",ans,ans,ang
But Kate,b,b,dis
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. And laugh -- laugh at me but",s,s,dis
Calm yourself.,c,c,dis
I need you to believe with me; I can't stand all alone.,o,o,sad
Calm yourself.,c,c,dis
"Even last week there was a man who showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.",s,s,dis
All right. All right. Calm yourself.,c,c,dis
Just you above all need to believe.,o,o,dis
Don't stop believing.,ans,ans,dis
"What does that mean, me above all?",q,q,ang
Look at you -- look at you shaking.,s,s,ang
I can't help it.,o,s,dis
"What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",q,q,dis
"I know, it went out of style, didn't it?",q,q,hap
It's all right.  It's a good thing.,ans,ans,hap
"You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.",o,o,hap
"No, not sorry.  But, um. But I'm not gonna stay.",ans,ans,hap
What?,q,q,sur
"The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you on a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.",s,s,dis
"I knew they would, your mother anyway.",ag,ag,hap
"Well, from her point of view, why else would I come?",ans,ans,neu
I guess this is why I came.,o,o,hap
I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.,o,o,hap
Why didn't you?,q,q,sur
"Well, you started to write me",ans,ans,hap
You felt something that far back?,q,q,hap
Every day since.,ans,ans,hap
"Ann, why didn't you let me know?",q,q,hap
Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.,s,s,sad
No.  Nothing like that.,ans,ans,sad
"Well, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",q,q,sad
"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",ans,ans,sad
It wouldn't work this way.,s,s,sad
"Well, I lost them.",s,s,sad
Just about all.,ans,ans,sad
It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.,o,o,sad
"For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had.",s,s,sad
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",o,o,sad
"To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",o,o,sad
"Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.",s,s,sad
"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",s,s,sad
"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",o,o,sad
Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.,o,o,sad
Do you still feel that way?,q,q,sad
I want you now Annie.,ans,ans,neu
"Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris.  Everything, you understand that?  Me too.",o,o,sad
"I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.",o,o,sad
What'll I do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight.,q,q,hap
"God, this great, isn't it? Like look at the night we go here, it couldn't be better.",o,o,hap
How you doing?,q,q,hap
Fine.,ans,ans,neu
"Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell.",s,s,hap
"Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think?",q,q,hap
How you doing? You know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How - how could I forget to bring my flashlight? How could I be so stupid?,s,s,hap
What flashlight?,q,q,neu
"You know the flashlight, the silver one, there is only one, isn't there?",ans,ans,dis
That's not your flashlight.,s,s,dis
Who's is it?,q,q,dis
It's ours; it's mine too.,ans,ans,dis
But you kept saying my flashlight as if somehow it's just yours. I mean how is it supposed to make me feel?,q,q,dis
Yea.,b,ans,neu
"You cold, you want my jacket? We should've - we should've brought our blanket, our blanket, how could we forget to bring the blanket?",s,s,hap
"Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget,",s,s,hap
"oh man. Like a kid, it's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.",o,o,hap
You think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,q,q,hap
I'm cold.,s,s,neu
It's after eleven. Let's just go home.,s,s,dis
"Are you kidding, we'd miss it. We, we just got here. What's the point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home?",q,q,dis
There is no point in coming down here.,ans,ans,dis
That's my point.,s,s,dis
So let's go.,c,c,dis
Not particularly.,ans,ans,neu
Why not?,q,q,sur
"I don't, it's just stupid.",ans,ans,dis
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year.",s,s,hap
"Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up.",s,s,hap
"Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach flop around and swim away, and then they die.",s,s,dis
"Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that.",s,s,hap
"This is a big night for these guys, life's last orgy.",o,o,hap
What are you so excited about? I mean it's not a moon landing we're talking about here it's fish. It's a fish nobody even eats.,o,o,dis
Yes they do.,dag,dag,dis
Augie,b,b,dis
"Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs",s,s,hap
"you know there is like, there is a certain mystery here, a magic, a bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you cannot be interested.",o,o,hap
I'm just not.,s,s,sad
For real?,q,q,sur
Yes.,ans,ans,neu
"And then last year I remember specifically you were so excited that you stubbed your toe on the way pushing me out of the house, and you didn't even notice until we got in the car.",s,s,dis
"Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions.",s,s,ang
We didn't see them the first time either.,s,s,dis
We just weren't in a good spot; this is a much better spot. I've got good instincts for these things.,o,o,dis
"There is that, oh no that's just seaweed, isn't it?",q,q,hap
"This is, this is great, isn't it? I wouldn't miss this for anything. Now listen to this, I know you're not interested but just listen.",c,c,hap
"Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way,",s,s,hap
"they don't why, we don't know why. They didn't take a vote or anything; they didn't get a map or an invitation.",s,s,hap
"Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker, instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the California coast and started swimming. They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.",s,s,hap
"It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question,",o,o,hap
"they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.",s,s,hap
Look at me; I'm giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up.,s,s,hap
That's the wind.,s,s,neu
About what?,q,q,neu
It's ridiculous.,o,o,dis
So what do you think?,q,q,neu
What I was saying.,ans,ans,neu
It's ridiculous.,o,o,dis
Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,dag,dag,neu
"Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong but are you having your period?",q,q,dis
Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.,ans,ans,ang
"Well, what's bugging you?",q,q,dis
We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.,ans,ans,ang
"There is nothing to it, we come here, the Grunion arrive, then do their little fish business, we go oh ah look, they go home, we go home.",s,s,dis
For heavens sake we are not going to see the Grunions.,o,o,dis
Why not?,q,q,dis
"We never do, do we? I mean have we ever?",q,q,dis
We've missed them twice; that's not ever.,ans,ans,dis
"Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever.",s,s,dis
"Well, we'll see them this year.",o,o,neu
"No we won't; it's pointless. It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus,",dag,dag,dis
I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.,o,o,ang
I thought you wanted to see them.,o,o,dis
You don't understand anything I'm saying.,s,s,dis
No of course not.,dag,dag,dis
"I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is.",o,o,ang
For heavens sake this isn't about fish.,s,s,dis
All right. I've been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst.,s,s,dis
"You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said",s,s,neu
"the Grunion are running tonight, I said ""great, let's go, I feel lucky,""",s,s,neu
"okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-",s,s,neu
Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.,s,s,sad
"We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",s,s,sad
And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them,s,s,sad
"and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be",s,s,sad
"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",s,s,sad
"It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?",q,q,hap
"Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?",q,q,hap
I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.,ans,ans,sad
"Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?",q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,sad
You want to go get some champagne?,q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,sad
Take off our shoes?,q,q,neu
Get married again?,q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,dis
What? What? You want a divorce?,q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,dis
A vacation?,q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,dis
"A new carpet? A poodle, a ice cream, backrub, a suicide pact, what, what Carla, what the hell do you want?",q,q,dis
I want something to turn out the way that it supposed to.,ans,ans,dis
"Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?",q,q,ang
"No, no, just like you I thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three, fat, rosy kids and ha-ha baby the joke is on us",o,o,dis
"cause you know what you get Carla, you know what you get? This.",s,s,dis
"This? What, what is this? This isn't even anything.",s,s,dis
"I'm sure, this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, this is fighting.",o,o,dis
"Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.",o,o,sad
"No, I know. Me neither.",ag,ag,sad
I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?,q,q,dis
"I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",o,o,sad
Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,o,o,sad
"No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.",ag,ag,sad
Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?,q,q,hap
"You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.",o,o,sad
"Now that you mention it. No, I don't.",dag,dag,hap
I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.,o,o,hap
What have we got here?,s,s,hap
"Well, I guess we don't need glasses.",s,s,hap
"Augie, I'm sorry.",ap,ap,sad
"Shh, if we're very quiet the fish might come.",o,o,hap
Or not.,ag,o,hap
Or not.,ag,ag,hap
Hmm.,b,b,neu
Good God.,s,s,fea
Must be them then.,o,o,fea
What are we going to do?,q,q,hap
"We're all right darling, aren't we whatever happens?",s,s,fea
Now and always sweet.,ag,ag,hap
Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number.,s,s,hap
Oh. It sends shivers down my spine.,s,s,hap
What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,q,q,fea
With the most perfect poise.,q,q,hap
"Yes, I should probably to a court curtsey.",ans,ans,hap
"Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy, do they?",q,q,hap
Oh darling don't say that.,c,c,sad
Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love?,q,q,hap
What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth?  Good God what does it all mean?,q,q,hap
"You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.",o,o,hap
Who's they?,q,q,hap
flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light.,o,o,hap
"Certainly you must, we figures of fun all right.",ag,ag,hap
"No, that desire will fade along with our passion.",ans,ans,sad
"Oh dear, should we like that?",q,q,sad
"Well, what happens if one of us dies, does the one that's left still laugh?",q,q,fea
"Yes, yes, with all his might.",ans,ans,hap
"No, no it isn't, death is very laughable, such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.",ans,ans,hap
So is everyone else in the long run.,o,o,hap
"Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers, let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can. Like quite idiotic, very small, school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment.",o,o,hap
Come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,o,o,hap
You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,q,q,hap
Which particular one?,q,q,hap
"Oh Charles, that was his name Charles. It did wiggle so beautifully.",s,s,hap
I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal; I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,ag,ag,hap
It went on intermittently for days.,ans,ans,hap
It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,s,s,hap
"That was a rouser, wasn't it?",q,q,hap
The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,s,s,hap
I'll never forget his face.,s,s,hap
"Oh it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous.",o,o,hap
And very much sillier.,o,o,hap
You knew there was nothing in that.,dag,dag,hap
I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,s,s,ang
"Presents, just a trivial little broach.",s,s,hap
No it wasn't. It was very pretty I still have it and I wear it often.,dag,dag,neu
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,s,s,ang
"No I didn't, you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.",dag,dag,neu
You let him kiss you; you said you did.,s,s,ang
What of it?,b,q,neu
"It gave him a lot of pleasure, it didn't hurt me any.",s,s,neu
What about me?,q,q,ang
"Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn't have known anything about it.",ans,ans,neu
I'm bored of this conversation.,o,o,dis
No thanks.,ans,ans,neu
I have a little I think.,s,s,neu
"No particular reason. Anyhow, they are very small ones.",s,s,neu
It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,o,o,neu
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.,o,o,neu
"Well, it's become a habit with you.",o,o,neu
What?,q,q,ang
Nothing.,ans,ans,dis
No I'm just making myself fascinating for you.,ans,ans,neu
"Going out somewhere, dear?",q,q,neu
"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",ag,ag,neu
"Oh, no it isn't.",dag,dag,dis
Be quiet.,c,c,ang
"Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",o,o,dis
Oh nonsense they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,dag,dag,dis
They snap.,dag,dag,dis
I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.,o,o,ang
"Tell me, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?",q,q,neu
"Yes, I did quite a lot.",ans,ans,neu
What riotous time you must have had.,o,o,ang
"No restraint at all, very enjoyable, never had much anyhow.",o,o,ang
Oh be quiet.,c,c,ang
"We can get a good little debate going about that, don't you think? Intemperate tots.",o,o,ang
All right. I will.,ag,ag,neu
Better turn that off I think.,o,o,neu
I'll do no such thing.,dag,dag,dis
"Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.",dag,dag,dis
You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.,o,o,ang
Turn it off.,c,c,ang
Stop it. Stop it. I hate you.,c,c,ang
"Amanda, listen. Listen.",c,c,ang
"Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.",o,o,ang
Very amusing indeed.,dag,dag,ang
"Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.",o,o,ang
"You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live.",o,o,ang
"This is the end, do you hear? The end finally and forever.",s,s,ang
You're not going like this.,c,c,ang
Oh yes I am.,dag,dag,ang
You're not.,dag,dag,ang
"Yes, I am. Let go of me you're cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you. Thank God I realized who you really are before I would ever, ever marry you again. I would never marry you again. I'd rather die in torment.",o,o,ang
Shut up.,c,c,ang
Shut up.,c,c,ang
I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.,o,o,ang
You're a beast. I hate you. Stop it. Stop it.,o,o,ang
"Oh, um-",b,b,neu

"You didn't fill this out right. All right. It says that you have to fill out the back sheet of this, but you filled out the yellow sheet of it.",ans,ans,neu
"No, no, no, no, no, no. The lady over there, she told me to fill out the front and she said to wait in this line.",dag,dag,dis

"No, no, no. You don't understand. This is--these are my belongings in the luggage. And I went to Paris.",ans,ans,dis
"Sir, why are you laughing at me? This isn't funny.",q,o,dis
"I think that's kind of stupid, that you put a hundred thousands of dollars in the bag.",o,o,neu
Did you lock- Did you lock it even? You probably didn't even lock it.,q,q,dis
"No, they said I couldn't lock it.",ans,ans,ang
Give me--I'm going to talk to your supervisor. Give me your supervisor. I want to talk to your supervisor right now.,c,c,ang
"Okay, let me get him.Oh, guess who the supervisor is? It's me.",s,s,neu
"What, do you have questions?",q,q,neu
"Well, get- I want the C.E.O. then.",s,s,ang
How you doing?,q,q,neu
Okay.,ag,ans,sad
Yeah. Wow.,b,b,sad
We're all going to miss him.,o,o,neu
"Mmm hmm. I never knew it was going to be this hard, you know.",o,o,sad
It's weird 'cause it's like you expected it to happen and eventually-,o,o,sad
"he had cancer, you know?",s,s,sad
"They thought he got--would get better and he did, and then it just- things turned bad.",s,s,sad
"Turned around for the worst, you know.",s,s,sad
"I didn't know him, Tricia, but uh- I heard that he was a great man.",s,s,sad
He was amazing.,o,o,sad
I loved that boy.,o,o,sad
"We did everything together, you know.",s,s,sad
"It's weird, I think. I feel so alone, you know? What am I going to do now? Now that he's gone.",q,q,sad
He's so young. It seems so--,s,s,sad
so wrong in so many ways.,o,o,sad
"His poor parents. You know, it's their only son.",s,s,sad
yeah.,ag,b,neu
"Kind of a whole year. I mean, he suffered with this, this monster, this thing, this disease.",s,s,sad
"He was in chemo the whole time, right?",q,q,sad
And he just got that baseball scholarship.,s,s,sad
"I know. He was, he had so much going for him.",ag,ag,sad
"So handsome, so young, so gifted.",o,o,sad
So talented.,o,o,sad
"Such a sweet person, you know?",o,o,sad
How's his parents doing?,q,q,sad
Not very good.,ans,ans,sad
"Can you imagine, though, you know, as a parent, just losing a kid? Twenty-two years old.",o,o,sad
He was my brother.,s,s,sad
"Just seems so unfair, is the way it is.",o,o,sad
"You know, he had that really pretty girlfriend for like about a year and-",s,s,sad
What was her name?,q,q,sad
Kelly. Kelly Uveny.,ans,ans,sad
They talked about getting married and--,s,s,sad
Trying to have a baby.,s,s,sad
"Yeah. But then when he got cancer and it got bad, you know, she just took off and-",ans,ag,sad
so I was there for him.,s,s,sad
Some people.,o,o,sad
"Yeah, but you were there all the hospital days. By his bed-",s,s,sad
"Yeah. God, I loved that kid.",o,o,sad
"So nice, so positive.",o,o,sad
yeah.,ag,ag,sad
We need more people like him.,o,o,sad
"Joe, do you think he knew I loved him?",q,q,sad
I don't know.,s,ans,sad
"I never told him, I love you, but-",s,s,sad
I loved him so much.,o,o,sad
I don't know if Benny was smart like that- but-,o,o,sad
I'm sure he loved you too. He just didn't know it.,o,o,sad
"Hey, Isabella.",g,g,neu
"Uh-, So I got some good news.",s,s,hap
You're not pregnant or anything.,q,q,neu
I have some better news than that.,s,ans,hap
"Yes, What would you want more than anything in this world?",q,q,hap
Which one?,q,q,hap
"I got--U.S.C.. I got- Yeah, I got the acceptance letter.",ans,ans,hap

"Yes, me, I got in. Thank you very much.",ans,ans,hap
Good for you.,o,o,hap
"Yeah, I know, my mom called me. I was with my girlfriend in Boston, and uh- she got the letter and she called me, she said I don't know, do you want me to open it? And I was like yes, open it. And she opened it and she goes oh, I'm sorry, Nat.",s,s,hap
"And my mom was like Natalie, Natalie, it's [GARBAGE], you know-",s,s,hap
oh yeah.,b,b,neu
"and so, I mean, I got in.",s,s,hap
"Oh, Jesus. That is so amazing.",o,o,hap
So now I can stay here and now we can party. I know.,o,o,hap
Party. You want to get drunk tonight?,q,q,hap
"Yeah, why not.",ans,ans,hap
"Yeah, we're going to celebrate.",o,o,hap
"We're not twenty one yet, but whatever.",s,s,neu
"[LAUGHTER]. I'm so excited, Joe. Oh, man, I-- And I got in--I got into the school of theatre, so it's like-",s,s,hap
Shit. That's-,b,b,sur
"Oh, my God. That's--I heard it's top five-- --in the Grauman scale or something.",s,s,sur
Yeah. It's really cool.,ag,ag,hap
Top five in the nation.,s,s,hap
Who-whooooo. Miss Acti- Acting Pants.,s,s,hap
"Acting Pants? So what are you going to do? Are you--you're be--you're going to stay here, right?",q,q,hap
I got into film school at the Art Academy.,s,ans,neu
Awesome. We're both going to be in L.A.,o,s,hap
So I'm going to be--yeah. I'm going to make films; you're going to be in them.,o,o,hap
"I'm so excited. Yeah, I thought I was going to go to Boston, but then--",s,s,hap
Fuck Boston.,s,o,neu
"Oh man, I'm so excited. So much to do.",o,o,hap
I'm just so excited to start my life.,o,o,hap
We should uh- go to Little Ethiopia.,s,s,neu
"Oh, and you sit down and you have the sponge bread-- --and eat the--drink the beer. Ugh, I love that stuff. I'm so excited.",o,o,hap
Are you going to come stay in my dorm with me sometime?,q,q,hap
"Hell, yeah. Pass out.",ans,ans,hap
Yeah. I'll get like one of those little--,s,s,hap
Yeah. Those little-- --mattresses. I'll put it by my bed.,s,s,hap

"No, I'll sleep in your bed. Cuddle up.",s,s,hap
Uh-oh.,b,b,hap
That's going to--that'll be reserved for somebody else.,o,o,neu
[LAUGHTER] Hello? I am not.,dag,dag,hap
Yeah.,ag,b,hap
"Well, get used to it.",o,o,neu
"[LAUGHTER]. No, you'd get used to it.",o,o,hap
"Hey, I'm already getting used to it.",o,ag,hap
"[LAUGHTER]. Oh, Joe, I'm so happy.",o,o,hap
"Me too, Isabella.",a,a,hap
"Hey, you stupid dumb shit machine, give me a fucking operator, huh?",q,q,ang
"Hello sir, can I help you?",q,q,neu
"Yes, sir, I'm very sorry, but we've had some trouble here.  There's been a lot of calls and the system has-",ans,ans,neu
"Sir, please calm down.  There's no reason to use profanity like that.  It's not-",s,c,neu
"Well, um- we have a little problem with the system going on.  One of our satellites is down, and I-",s,s,neu
You know what?  I'm just going to- Patient?  I'm a busy man.,o,s,ang
"You're going to have to just be patient with us, sir, as we",s,s,neu
"Well, I know sir, and we all are busy.",ag,ag,neu
But I'm going to definitely have to- uh--get your contact information,s,s,neu
"-have to, have to what?",q,q,ang
What?  It's my phone.  You can't even call me on it. I don't have another phone.,ans,ans,ang
"Okay, well, if you would like, um- we will be turning on the systems in probably about ten hours.",s,s,neu
What?  Are you kidding me?,q,q,ang
"Sir, I'm very sorry, but this is the way it is.  This- We have no control over it.  It's going to take-  -but you have to be patient with us.  You can use a calling card.  We will give you a free calling card to use.",ans,ans,neu
"Oh, my God.",b,b,ang
I- I'm going to kill myself right now.,o,o,ang
A free calling card?,q,q,ang
"Do you have a land line, sir?",q,q,neu
"Okay, well, we will send you- We will reimburse you for the amount of minutes that you-",s,s,neu
-on average would use.,s,s,neu
"That's it? Okay, yeah.  What else?",q,q,ang
"And we will probably send you a calling card.  I'm very sorry.  You're just going to have to be patient, sir.",ans,ans,neu
"Okay, I need more than this.  Are you going to give me a little bit more?",q,q,ang
"No, we don't just give you things.  We're- we're-",ans,ans,neu
we compensating you for all your-,s,s,neu
So you take things from me and you expect me just to wait around.,o,o,dis
"No no, we're not taking anything from you sir.  This is- This is unbeknownst to us.  The problem had just happened.",s,dag,dis
The satellite-is down in your area.,s,s,dis
"Okay, so you think you're going to-  -get me back some minutes, and that's going to make up for three days of business that I lost?  Okay, great.",q,o,dis
"No, three days, sir.  It's not three days. It's- It's only been about a day now. Let's not exaggerate.",dag,dag,dis
"No, it's been--three days.",ans,dag,dis
"Fine, it's been a day.  Okay?",ag,ag,dis
Three days?,q,q,neu
A day?,s,s,neu
"I don't know, sir.",ans,ans,neu
About three million dollars.,s,s,neu
"Oh, well, I'm sorry about that. Umm- We-",ap,ap,neu
"Well, ten hours worth of minutes--",ans,ans,neu
is what's going to happen.,s,s,neu
"Sir,",b,b,neu
"what I would like what I'm advising you to do now is just to write down all of your problems that you-you feel that--You know, haven't been addressed, fax it to us-",s,s,neu
"Oh, my God.",b,b,dis
and we will take care of it if anything happens.  But all we can do now is ask for your patience.,s,s,neu
Okay? Thank you for calling.  Goodbye.,g,g,neu
He saw it.,s,s,neu
He was out there when it happened.,ans,ans,neu
I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen.,ans,ans,neu
Did you talk to him?,q,q,neu
"No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone.",ans,ans,neu
"He cried hard, huh?",q,q,neu
I could hear it right through the floor.,ans,ans,neu
I guess he is.,ag,ans,neu
"Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died, you know?",q,o,neu
I don't know.,s,ans,neu
"But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad.",o,o,neu
Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,ans,ans,neu
"What do you mean, dishonest?",q,q,neu
"What, you're going to argue with him?",q,q,dis
"No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time that he realized that no one believes that Larry's coming back anymore.",ans,ans,dis
You can't tell him that.,c,c,dis
We got to tell him that.,c,dag,dis
We can't. It just won't work.,ans,o,dis
"You know, for God's sakes it's been three years. No one comes back after three years. It's insane.",o,o,dis
They do come back.,ans,dag,neu
"All right. Just- Sit down, mom. I want to talk to you.",c,c,dis
"It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry.",s,s,ang
"All right. All right. Just come on, sit down.",c,c,dis
What?,q,q,dis
"You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?",q,q,neu
Why?,q,q,neu
You know.,ans,ans,neu
I want to ask her to marry me.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, that's only your business, Chris.",o,o,neu
"Come on, you know that's not only my business.",dag,dag,dis
"Well, it is. I mean, what do you want me to do? You're grown up; you know what's going on in your mind.",q,q,dis
So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, you better make sure your father's not- No- I'm just saying.",s,s,dis
"See, then it's not just my business. God, you have",s,s,ang
"-Oh, you infuriate me sometimes. You know, it's not just my business too if dad throws a fit.",o,o,ang
"Yeah, well I ignore what I got to ignore.",ag,ag,dis
And she-she's Larry's girl.,s,s,dis
"Well, from your father's point of view she is. I mean, he's still alive. You've got no right to take her.",dag,dag,dis
"Cause listen, I'm telling you, I don't know where to go from there. Do you?",q,q,dis
What do you want from me?,q,q,dis
"Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.",o,o,sad
You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.,o,o,neu
To hell with that.,dag,dag,ang
There's nothing wrong with it.,o,o,neu
I didn't ask Annie yet.,ans,ans,neu
You didn't ask her yet?,q,q,dis
I wanted to get this settled first.,ans,s,neu
Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.,ans,ans,neu
"I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right?",q,q,neu
"Mom, don't avoid me.",c,c,dis
"You know, the trouble is you've never had enough women. No, you never did.",o,o,dis
So what? I'm not fast with women.,ag,s,dis
I don't understand why it has to be her.,q,q,dis
Because it is.,s,ans,neu
"That's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.",o,o,dis
I just-,b,b,dis
"I mean, you haven't seen her since the war. I mean, it's been five years.",s,s,dis
It just is. I-,b,b,neu
"I grew up with her. Okay. All these years, when I think of someone I want to be my wife I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?",q,q,dis
"No, I don't want a diagram.",ans,ans,dis
"He thinks he's coming back. You go-go on and marry her, I mean, you're pronouncing her dead. And what's going to happen to your father, huh? I don't know. Do you?",s,s,dis
"Okay. All right, then.",a,a,dis
"Just, listen. Give it more thought, is all.",c,c,dis
"No, I've given it three years of thought.",s,s,dis
But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.,s,o,neu
I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.,ans,ans,neu
You're what-you're going to leave the business? But you can't do that. What the hell is this?,q,q,dis
The business. The business doesn't inspire me.,ans,ans,dis
"Oh, you have to be inspired.",q,q,dis
Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.,ans,ans,ang
"Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.",s,s,ang
"Now, where do I find it?",q,q,neu
Tell me something.,c,c,neu
You'd leave that business.,q,q,neu
Yes. On this I would.,ans,ans,neu
You can't do that.,dag,dag,dis
Then help me stay here.,c,c,neu
"All right, but you can't do that. You can't talk like that.",ag,ag,dis
Okay. Just-,ag,ag,neu
"We've worked all our lives for you. Only for you, Chris. The whole shootin' match is for you.",o,o,dis
"Yeah, I know, I know, just help me stay here, all right?",q,ag,dis
I'm going to.,ag,a,neu
I am thinking like that.,dag,dag,neu
"I don't know you, do I?",q,q,neu
"No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.",ans,ans,neu
Yeah. I can see that.,ag,ag,neu
Why did you invite her here?,q,q,ang
She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and-,ans,ans,ang
"Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.",ans,o,neu
You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.,s,o,ang
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,q,q,neu
It's got that about it.,ans,ans,ang
"Well, so what?",q,q,neu
"Listen, kid-",b,b,dis
She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.,dag,s,ang
You can't read her mind.,o,o,neu
How do you know why she's waited?,q,q,neu
"She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her-",o,o,sad
"Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?",q,q,neu
"Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother.",ans,ans,ang
Calm yourself.,c,c,neu
Calm yourself.,c,c,dis
"Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.",c,c,ang
"Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe.",s,s,ang
All right. All right. Calm yourself.,c,c,ang
Okay. Just calm yourself.,c,c,dis
"No, you've got to believe.",c,c,sad
"Why me, above all?",q,q,ang
Huh?,q,q,ang
Why me above all?,q,q,ang
You got to keep believing.,ans,ans,sad
"Look at you, you're shaking.",s,s,ang
I can't help it.,o,s,sad
What have I got to hide?,q,q,ang
"Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate?",q,q,ang
"No, it's all right. There's nothing wrong in that, you know.",ans,ans,hap
It's really lovely here. The air is sweet.,o,o,hap
You're not sorry you came?,q,q,neu
No. I'm not sorry. It's-,ans,ans,sad
"Well, for one thing, your mother so much has told me to go. [LAUGHTER].",ans,ans,dis
Well-,b,b,neu
What?,q,q,neu
"Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.",ans,ans,sad
"Oh look, um, well, the thing is, I was planning on, planning on sort of sneaking up on you over a week or so, and they-they take it for granted we're all set.",s,s,hap
"I, I guess that's why I asked you to come.",o,o,hap
"Well, I mean,",ag,ag,hap
"Oh, Annie.",a,a,hap
"from her opinion, why else would I come here?",o,o,hap
"Annie, I love you.",o,o,hap
I love you a great deal.,o,o,hap
I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it.,s,s,hap
"Well, I guess that's why I came.",o,o,hap
"I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here, don't you? This yard and this chair.",s,o,hap
I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me.,o,o,hap
"I've been ready for a long, long time.",o,o,hap
Why didn't you?,q,q,sur
You felt something that far back?,q,q,hap
Every day since.,ans,ans,hap
Why didn't you let me know?,q,q,hap
"Give me a kiss, Annie.",c,c,hap
Give me-,c,c,hap
I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.,o,o,hap
We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.,o,o,hap
I kissed you.,s,s,hap
"Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris.",o,o,hap
Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.,ans,ans,sad
No. What is it? Is it your mother?,q,q,sad
"No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.",ans,ans,neu
"Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.",q,q,sad
"Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now.",ans,ans,sad
You should tell me.,o,o,sad
I don't know where to start.,s,s,sad
"But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.",s,s,sad
You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.,s,s,sad
"Yeah, sure.",ans,ag,sad
"Well, I lost them.",s,s,sad
How many?,q,q,sad
Just about all.,ans,ans,sad
Geez.,b,b,sad
It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.,o,o,sad
"For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket.",s,s,sad
"I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.",o,o,sad
"And I, and I thought something watching them go down.",o,o,sad
"Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?",o,o,sad
And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.,o,o,sad
And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.,s,s,sad
And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.,s,s,sad
"And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.",s,s,sad
"Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.",o,o,sad
And I didn't want to take any of it.,o,o,sad
And I guess that included you.,o,o,sad
And you still feel that way?,q,q,sad
"Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.",o,o,sad
"Annie,",b,b,hap
"Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you.",o,o,hap
What am I going to do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
"Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it?",q,q,hap
Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.,o,o,hap
"You know actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the, the people and the lights, and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey, how you doing?",q,q,hap
Fine.,ans,ans,sad
"Oh, is that-is that-now, is that just foam, uhh, I can't even tell.",s,s,hap
"Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing?",q,q,hap
"Oh, do you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid. Oh, I-I should have brought my flashlight.",s,s,hap
"Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?",ans,ans,hap
"I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?",q,q,ang
We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.,s,q,hap
I hope the moon stays out.,o,o,hap
"Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?",q,q,hap
"We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket.",s,s,hap
"You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.",s,s,hap
I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].,o,o,hap
I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move.,q,q,hap
Do you want my jacket?,q,q,neu
What? Are you kidding me? We just got here. We'd miss it. What's the point of coming down there if we just turn around and go home?,q,q,sur
Right.,ag,b,neu
"Yeah, that's my point too.",ag,ag,neu
"No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave.",dag,dag,hap

What the...what am I doing?,q,q,sad
"Well now you can follow his footsteps, you know?  Carry out what he wanted to do.",o,o,sad
I can't do that.,dag,dag,sad

"I have some bad news.  I was like what?  She's like not really you got into U.S.C. and I was like, I was like oh my God.  I was about to tear my own hair out.",s,s,hap
Oh man.,b,o,hap
Oh my God the first minute I got it I sent it back in.,ans,ans,hap
"This is so great, you know, because I gone fit on downtown so I'm going to be like right here.  I think I'm going to be living at City Lights downtown.",o,o,hap
This is so exciting.  This is like a new chapter in our lives.,o,o,hap
"Yeah, it really is.",ag,ag,hap
"We're doing what we want to do, then four years later we're going to be working professionals, making money, sipping martinis every day.",o,o,hap
Man I'm just so happy for you.  I just--,o,o,hap
Thank you,g,g,hap
"Well, I'm happy for you but I'm happy for me cause that means you're going to stay.",o,o,hap

Oh great. I would love to go.,o,o,hap
Yeah and they said get whatever you want and...,s,s,hap
This is going to be so great.  I have so many great ideas.,o,o,hap
Hello.  This is Viacom Services.  How can I help you?,q,q,neu
"Hello?  God finally somebody, look, this is ridiculous.  I've been waiting online for like a half an hour now.",ans,ans,dis
"I'm sorry ma'am, what can I help you with?",q,q,neu
"Look my, my phone isn't working.  I don't understand what's going on.  I am trying to call out.  I'm not receiving any calls",ans,ans,dis
"and I need assistance with my...not only is my work phone, it's my home phone and look,",s,s,dis
this is my business.  This is how I make money is through my phone.  It needs to be working.  Can you please help me?,q,q,dis
Okay.  Can you give me the last four digits of your social security number so I can verify who I'm speaking with?,q,q,neu
two two six six.,ans,ans,neu
Okay.  And your name is?,q,q,neu
Olivia.,ans,ans,dis
Olivia. Um. Okay.  So how long has this problem been?,q,q,neu
"This has been going on for the past two weeks.  I called every single day.  Nobody is helping me.  You guys tell me the same thing over and over, call again, call again, call again--",ans,ans,dis
Um- I think part of it has to do with the network being down.  It's been having some trouble the last few weeks--,o,o,neu
"Okay.  Well that is, that is fine and all.  I don't care.  I really don't care because I want my phone to work that's all.",o,o,dis
"That is I am paying you guys for service and I'm not getting any service.  I get, I get just dropped calls all the time and now it's completely not working at all.  I can't even call out, nine one one probably wouldn't even work.",s,s,dis
Well you better.  You better give me a whole freaking new phone that's what you better do.,o,s,dis
"You sign the contract and then down the line the phone doesn't work and you're stuck, you can't go to a new...no.  No contracts for me.  You give me a new phone.",s,s,ang
"Besides, it's sort of out of hands at the moment----The whole electrical power outage.",s,s,dis
I want to talk to a supervisor,s,s,ang
I would like to talk to your supervisor.  Obviously you're incompetent and don't understand what I'm asking.,s,s,ang
"Um- Let me connect you to my supervisor.  Actually, he's out right now so I'm supervisor until he comes back. Um-",s,s,neu
What?,q,q,dis
"So you could----speak with me some more, you could call back later on maybe.",s,s,neu
That's ridiculous.  You know?,o,o,dis
"No I don't want to call back, you put me on hold for like hours and hours----and it's money, money, money, money and out of my pocket, out of my pocket--",s,s,dis
I didn't put you on hold.,s,dag,dis
There are a lot of people calling us having problems.  Every phone company is having the same problems ma'am,s,s,dis
Every phone...every single phone company?,q,q,dis
"I am a realtor and this is my business.  People are calling me all the time but you know, and I don't have a land line.  I can't afford to have a land line",s,s,ang
don't you-,b,b,neu
I'm really sorry ma'am.  There's not----a lot we can do for it.,ap,ap,neu
"What I can do for you, if you want to make a call right now I could contact you through our computer.  I can call through my phone and you can speak through me.",s,s,neu
What?  No.  That's way too complicated.  Look--,o,o,dis
you need to fix my phone.  I don't care what you have to do--,c,c,dis
"Well, okay I'm going to give you a free phone card that you can use at any payphone and that's on us. Okay?",s,s,neu
"Yeah yeah, woman going out in South Central on the payphone at night.  Oh that's real safe.",ag,dag,dis
"I'm, I'm sorry you chose to live there um--",ap,ap,neu
"No, no, no.  I didn't choose to live here.  I work there.  Okay?  Yeah. work work work",dag,dag,dis
Well I'm sure maybe there's a phone at work you could use.,o,o,neu
"We can't call out.  We can't make out-- line.  I don't work, I work at another office.",dag,dag,dis
A law firm.  Thank you very much.,g,g,dis
All right um--,ag,ag,neu
"I work out of my home as a realtor and because I don't have a land line, I need a phone and because of now I don't have one I don't know what to do.  And you're not helping me at all.",s,s,dis
"In fact, give me your name sir, what's your name again?",q,q,dis
My name is Sara.,ans,ans,neu
"Sara Brown.  Sara Brown, um- yeah, I'm going to get off the phone with you. And then I'm going to call back and I'm going to give your supervisor your name because you're obviously incompetent to work here.",s,s,dis
"You know maam, we record this conversation so anything you say can be proven in a law of court so keep that in mind.",s,s,neu
Hello?,s,g,neu
Oh God I finally got...you know how long I've been waiting on line?  You put on hold for like five hours.  Geez.,s,s,dis
I'm sorry ma'am.  What's the nature of your problem?  But first can I get you to tell me your first and last name?,q,q,neu
Olivia Brown.,ans,s,dis
Alright Ms. Brown what's the nature of your problem?,q,q,neu
Well my phone isn't working and it hasn't been working for the last five days.,ans,ans,dis
Oh.  I'm sorry. Um- Did you drop it in water?,q,q,neu
"Yeah, yeah, yeah you better be sorry.",ag,o,ang
No I did not drop my phone in water.  I'm not five years old and just dropped my phone anywhere I see it.  Okay this is my business.,ans,ans,ang
Okay?  And it [GARBAGE]. My business is failing because my phone isn't working and I don't have a land line and I really can't handle this right now.,s,s,dis
"Um- well it's probably easy.  Can you any more symptoms either you're not receiving calls----ok, you're not receiving calls, not getting calls.",q,q,neu
"the symptoms- This [GARBAGE] a doctor's office. I'm not receiving calls...I can't receive- no, it's, it cuts me off--",ans,ans,dis
Is the phone turned on?,q,q,neu
Yes the phone turns on.  No I mean I'm using it not turning on the phone.  Of course it turns on.,ans,ans,dis
Alright.  Um- Well that could be the problem. cause--,o,o,neu
you might have an older phone where we would use sim cards but probably not.,s,s,neu
"Okay no.  Sir, this is the deal.  My phone isn't working and I don't care what the problem is but it needs to work.  That's why I'm paying you guys to fix it.",s,s,dis
Tell them my name.  My name is Brent Backersen.,s,s,neu
"Brent Backersen, I am writing this down, Brent Backersen.  Alright.",ag,ag,dis
Okay.  Tell them my - my ID number is two one three five.,s,s,neu
It will be free.  No contract okay?,q,ag,neu
Really?  No contract?,q,q,dis
"Go in there, yeah, go in there.  Tell them Brent Backersen sent you.",ans,ans,neu
"the top of the line camera phone, game boy, anything you want. For free. And palm pilot.",ag,ag,neu
They might only have orange.,dag,dag,neu
"Okay.  They can figure out pink for you.  So go in there and just tell them that and they'll hook you up with other goodies, stuff like that free service, no contract, no nothing.  Just for being a good customer",ag,ag,neu
and battling through with us.,s,s,neu
"Alright. Well-  I guess - I guess that's okay but,",o,o,neu
Okay.,ag,ag,neu
Alright?  Great.  Have a nice evening.,o,o,neu
Alright Thanks.,g,g,neu
What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.,o,o,neu
He was out there when it happened.,ans,ans,sad
When?,q,q,sur
About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.,ans,ans,sad
No.  I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.,ans,ans,sad
He cried hard?,q,q,sad
I could hear it right through the floor.,ans,ans,sad
Starting to dream about him again.  He's walking around at night again.,ans,ans,dis
I guess he is.,ag,ag,sad
"He's getting just like he did after he died, you know?  What, what, what's the meaning of this?",q,q,sad
"I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.",ans,ans,sad
Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,ans,ans,dis
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.,q,q,ang
"Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?",q,q,ang
That we haven't had any hope for years now?,q,q,ang
Larry's been gone for three years.  For god sakes no one comes back after three years.  It's insane.,ans,ans,dis
"Listen mom, just, sit down.  I want to talk to you.",c,c,dis
No.  It's his god damned newspapers is what it is.  Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one.,s,s,ang
Alright. Alright. Alright just listen.,c,c,dis
"You know why I asked Annie here, right?",q,q,neu
I want to ask her to marry me.,ans,ans,neu
You know it's not just my business.,dag,dag,dis
"Well what do you want me to do?  I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind.",o,o,ang
Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.,s,s,neu
"Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--",s,s,neu
Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things.,o,o,ang
Well I'm just saying--,s,s,dis
She's not Larry's girl.,dag,dag,dis
From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair.  You can't do that.,s,s,dis
I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull back,o,o,dis
"And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there, then you can.  But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go.  You got it?  I mean, do you?",q,q,dis
"My whole entire, bloody life time and time again.",o,o,dis
Did you ask Annie yet?,q,q,neu
Then I guess that's the end of it.,ans,ans,neu
But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.,o,o,sad
"And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",c,c,neu
"Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean...",o,o,neu
Because it is.,s,s,dis
It's just...that's just the way it is.  That's how I feel.  You know these years when I think of someone I want to marry I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram?,q,q,dis
No I don't want a diagram.,ans,ans,dis
"He thinks he's coming back. And you go off and marry that girl and you're just pronouncing him dead and what's going to happen to him?  I don't know.  Do you?  I mean, I don't know.",s,s,dis
Alright then.,a,a,dis
I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,ans,ans,sad
But if I can't have that here I'll get out.,s,s,neu
I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.,ans,ans,neu
I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.,ans,ans,ang
You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.,q,q,ang
The business doesn't inspire me.,ans,ans,ang
Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.,ans,ans,ang
Yes.  On this I would.,ans,ans,neu
Alright but you can't talk like that you hear?,s,s,dis
"I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you.",s,s,ang
I know.  Just you help me stay here.,ag,ag,sad
Alright but you don't talk like that you hear?  You don't.,c,c,dis
I am thinking like that.,dag,dag,sad
I don't understand you do I?,q,q,sad
No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,ans,ans,sad
Yeah.  I can see that.,ag,ag,sad
Why did he invite her here?,q,q,ang
Why does that bother you?,q,q,dis
Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.,ans,q,ang
"Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.",ans,ans,neu
uh-uh What do you mean?  They grew up next to each other their entire lives.  Why shouldn't he want to see her?,q,q,dis
Hey don't look at me like that.  I don't know anymore than you.,c,c,dis
Who said he even thought about that?,q,q,neu
"Well, so what?",q,q,neu
Now listen kid...,c,c,dis
No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.,o,o,ang
it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.,o,o,sad
Look at how nice the day is.  What are we arguing for?,q,q,dis
"No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.",ans,ans,ang
What do you want me to do?  What do you want?,q,q,dis
But Kate...,b,b,dis
"Laugh, laugh at me but I will.  Because you know what happened when she came here?  When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me.",s,s,ang
"Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe.",s,s,sad
"Alright, alright, calm yourself okay?  Calm yourself. Wait, wait.  What do you mean, me above all?",c,c,ang
"Wait, what does that mean?  Me above all?",q,q,ang
"Look at you, you're shaking.",s,s,ang
I can't help it.,o,o,sad
What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate?,q,q,ang
You're not sorry you came?,q,q,neu
No.  I'm not sorry.  But I'm not going to stay.,ans,ans,sad
"Look,",c,c,sad
"you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of...",s,s,sad
What?,q,q,neu
"Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came.",ans,ans,sad
"I mean, that's the reason why I asked you here.",o,o,hap
I love you.,o,o,hap
I guess that's why I came.,o,o,hap
"Look, I've been ready for a long, long time now.",s,s,hap
"Look, I almost got married two years ago.",ans,ans,hap
You felt something that far back.,s,q,hap
Every day since.,ans,ans,hap
"I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say?",ans,ans,hap
You'd always be so ambiguous.,o,o,hap
"Give me a kiss Ann, just give me...",c,c,hap
"Oh God.  Annie, I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie.",s,s,hap
I'll never forgive you for that.,o,o,hap
"I mean,  Why did you wait all these years?  There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.",o,o,hap
We're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.,o,o,hap
Not like that you're not.,o,o,hap
"Nothing.  Hey, let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.",ans,ans,sad
You remember overseas I was in command of a company?,q,q,sad
Well I lost them.,s,s,sad
How many?,q,q,sad
Just about all.,ans,ans,sad
Geez.,b,b,sad
Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.,o,o,sad
A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.,o,o,sad
"It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me?",o,o,sad
And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.,o,o,sad
And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.,s,s,sad
"And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all.",s,s,sad
"It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook,",s,s,sad
"open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator",s,s,sad
"cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that.",o,o,sad
Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.,o,o,sad
And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.,o,o,sad
And you still feel that way?,q,q,sad
"that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.",o,o,sad
Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.,o,o,hap
What am I going to do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
Buy some hats?,q,q,hap
"Hey, what time is it?  This pokes around midnight right?  God this is great isn't it?",q,q,hap
Look at the night we got.  I wouldn't trade this for anything.,o,o,hap
"Is that, is that, nah, is that just Paul?  I can't even tell.",s,s,hap
"But if I can't tell, it probably isn't them isn't it?  Probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think?  How are you doing?",q,q,hap
"Oh, you know what I forgot?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.",s,s,hap
Yes.,ans,ans,neu
"God.  Oh, you know what would be good right about now?  A six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket.",s,s,hap
"I'm so stupid, I should've brought a six-pack.  God, I'm like a little kid.  It's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped up. Oh- [LAUGHTER]",o,o,hap
I wonder if they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,q,q,hap
Do you want my jacket?,q,q,neu
"It's past eleven, let's go.",s,ans,dis
There is no point in coming down here.,ans,ans,dis
That's my point.,s,s,dis
That's my point too...No.  No.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point if we come down here if we just turn around and leave?,ag,ag,dis
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  It only happens once a year.  I mean think about the people in Kansas, they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this.  We're only forty minutes away.  This is too good to pass up.",s,s,hap
"Pass up what?  These fish swim up to shore, on the beach and then they flop around a little, they swim away and then they die.",s,s,dis
"Well this is like the highlight, the one night of their lives and that flopping around, that's laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it.",s,s,hap
"But this is the big night for these guys.  Their last, life's last orgy.",o,o,hap
Yeah they do.,dag,dag,hap
Augie.,b,b,dis
"Okay.  But it's fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows in Capistrano or the Lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs, there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable.",s,s,hap
I'm just not.,s,s,neu
"You also could remember that I got sand in my panties, we got in an argument over nothing, you got a sore throat and we didn't even get to see the Grunions.",s,s,dis
You didn't see them the first time either.,s,s,dis
"We just weren't in the good spot.  This is a much better spot.  You know, I have a good instincts for these things.",o,o,dis
"Look, is that...no is that just seaweed?",q,q,hap
"You know, this is great isn't it?  You know, I wouldn't trade this for anything.",o,o,hap
"I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.",c,c,hap
"Somewhere out there, there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way, they don't why, we don't know why, they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies...",s,s,hap
"...like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming this way.  They didn't, you know, they didn't make a decision, they didn't, you know, have boats or anything.  No one sent them an invitation or a map, they just started swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.",s,s,hap
"It's single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't, they don't ask it a question, they don't give it a name, they just swim.",o,o,hap
They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.,s,s,hap
"Oh, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are standing up.",s,s,hap
[BREATHING] So what do you think?,q,q,hap
About what I just said?,ans,ans,hap
So what do you think?,q,q,hap
About what?,q,q,ang
About what I just said?,ans,ans,dis
It's ridiculous.,o,o,ang
It certainly is not.  It's a slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,dag,dag,dis
"It's PR.  I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach.",o,o,ang
I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.,dag,dag,dis
"Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.",o,o,ang
Are we talking about the same thing?,q,q,dis
"Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.",ans,ans,ang
I thought you wanted to see it.,o,o,dis
"There's nothing to it.  The Grunions arrive, they do their little fish business, you know?  We go oh, ahh, look at the fish and they go home and we go home.",s,s,dis
"For heavens sake, grow up.  We're not going to see the Grunions.",o,o,dis
Why not?,q,q,dis
"We never do, do we?  Have we ever?",q,q,dis
"Oh my gosh.  We missed them twice, that's hardly ever.",ans,ans,dis
Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever.,s,s,ang
"Carla, can I ask you something?",q,q,dis
"Don't take this wrong but, are you having your period?",q,q,dis
"Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.",ans,ans,ang
What's bugging you then?,q,q,dis
"Look, it's pointless.  It's...we're not going to see the Grunions I mean, it's like waiting around to see Santa Claus, you know, it's...",ans,ans,dis
"Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up.",s,s,ang
I thought you wanted to see it.,o,o,dis
"God, you don't understand anything.",s,s,dis
"No, of course not.",dag,dag,dis
"I do.  I always do.  I keep thinking, this time will be the time and it never is.",o,o,dis
"Well, we're going to see it.",o,o,neu
"No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie.",dag,dag,ang
"What...I've been trying to, I've been trying to figure out the point where we went wrong and I can't seem to pinpoint that moment.",s,s,dis
"Look, do you remember the first time we came here?",q,q,dis
We thought I was pregnant.,s,s,sad
Wait a minute.  I've got it.,c,c,neu
It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker...,q,q,neu
And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that.,s,s,neu
You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right?,q,q,neu
I'd rather not remember something...,ans,ans,sad
Rather not hope for something.,o,s,sad
No.,ans,ans,sad
Do you want me to get some champagne?,q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,dis
Take off our shoes?,q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,dis
What?  Do you want me to breathe in your ear?,q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,dis
No...No...No...,dag,ans,dis
No...,ans,s,dis
I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.,ans,o,ang
Welcome to the human race.,s,s,ang
Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No.,q,q,ang
I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...,o,o,ang
...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.,s,s,ang
"This what...what's this?  This isn't anything. Alright.  Sure.  Standing on the beach, fighting and waiting.",o,o,dis
Yes it is.,dag,ag,ang
Right.,ag,ag,ang
Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.,o,o,ang
This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?,q,q,sad
I'm trying to do the best I can.,ans,ans,dis
I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice.,ag,ag,sad
I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.,o,o,sad
Maybe if you were with someone else too.,o,o,sad
I didn't say that.,dag,dag,sad
I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.,ag,ag,sad
"Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you.",o,o,sad
If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard.,o,o,sad
"Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people.",o,o,sad
I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here.,s,s,hap
Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water.,o,o,hap
"Hey, look what we got here.",s,s,hap
Oh you brought refreshments.,s,s,hap
No I'm beginning to think you might be right.,ans,ans,hap
I think this may be the place for us after all.,o,o,hap
I am sorry Augie.,ap,ap,hap
Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.,o,o,hap
Or not.,ag,o,hap
Or not.,ag,ag,hap
Now and always sweet.,ag,ag,hap
I don't care then.,s,s,hap
"I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later.",s,s,hap
That sent shivers up my spine.,s,s,hap
"No, wrong number.",s,s,hap
Behave exquisitely.,ans,ans,hap
That's serious enough.,o,o,sad
I didn't hit you very hard.,o,o,neu
Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.,s,s,neu
"Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that.",dag,dag,neu
Presents?  A trivial little broach.,s,s,ang
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,s,s,ang
No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.,dag,dag,neu
You must admit he was in love with you.,c,c,ang
Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.,ag,ag,neu
You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it?,q,q,ang
"Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me.",s,s,neu
And what about me?,q,q,ang
"Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.",o,o,ang
"Yeah, so am I.  Bored stiff.",ag,ag,ang
You want some brandy?,q,q,neu
I'll have a little I think.,s,s,neu
I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,s,s,ang
No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.,s,s,ang
I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.,o,o,ang
Oh my...just because I just...okay...,b,b,ang
It's become a habit with you.,o,o,neu
You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.,o,o,ang
Really Amanda.,dag,dag,dis
What?,q,q,ang
Nothing.,ans,ans,dis
Going out somewhere dear?,q,q,dis
"No, just making myself beautiful for you.",ans,ans,neu
That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you?,o,o,neu
Actually that's perfectly true.,ag,ag,neu
Yes it is.,dag,dag,neu
I think that,ag,ag,neu
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",dag,dag,ang
They sting.,dag,dag,ang
They snap.,dag,dag,dis
Mind your business.,c,c,ang
You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.,o,o,ang
I'm not in the least bit drunk.,dag,dag,ang
You've always had a weak head.,o,o,ang
"Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.",o,o,ang
"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy.",o,o,ang
"Oh, what an interesting topic.  What about a child of four and a child of six?  A child of nine?",q,q,ang
Shut up.,c,c,ang
We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.,o,o,ang
"Not very funny dear.  In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy.",o,o,ang
"Oh, thanks.  I think I will.",ag,ag,ang
You better turn that off.,o,o,ang
They are away in Tunis.,ans,ans,neu
"Turn it on again, please.",c,c,dis
No I'll do no such thing.,dag,dag,ang
Very well.  If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.,dag,dag,ang
"Come on, turn it off.  It's driving me mad.",c,c,ang
You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,o,o,ang
Turn it--Turn it off.,c,c,ang
Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.,c,c,ang
Very amusing indeed.,dag,dag,ang
"I hate you.  Listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",o,o,ang
"You know what?  You're a vile, little, evil-minded, little, wicked beast and I never want to see you again.",o,o,ang
"This is the end.  Understand?  This is the end, here and now, forever and always.",s,s,ang
You're not going nowhere. No you're not.,c,c,ang
"Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me.",dag,dag,ang
Just shut up.,c,c,ang
shut up. shut up.  I would-I would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you're an evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never see you again.,o,o,ang
"Listen, you're a cruel fiend and I hate, loathe you.  Thank God finally, finally thank God I've realized just how horrible you are--and marry you?  Marry you?  Never. I will never marry you.  I will die die in torment-",o,o,ang
Beast. Brute. Cad. Swine. Beast. Beast. Brute. Devil. Sorry.,o,o,ang
Oh.,b,b,ang
"Uh, lets- What do you need exactly?",q,q,dis
Well I filled out all the forms and I've given them to everyone and they keep sending me to someone else.,ans,ans,dis
"You need a new license, is that what you're telling me?",q,q,dis
Yes.  I'm just trying to get a new license.,ans,ans,dis
Let me see the form. Just let me see the form. Yeah.  You filled this out wrong.  I can't - I can't - I can't do anything with this.,s,s,dis
Okay.  I did-,ag,b,dis
Ma'am I cannot help you.  You need to fill out a new form and you need to get in the back of the line.,s,s,dis
I did exactly what they told me to do.,s,s,ang
I have done everything everyone in this entire place has told me to do.  I've been here for over an hour.  They make me wait in line.  Every single time I start over again.,s,s,dis
Ma'am I can't help you.  Do you understand?,q,q,dis
I have a life.  I have things to do.  I have places to go.  Can you not just put this through please?,s,s,dis
I've got a life too ma'am,s,s,ang
and I got to - i got to work here all day long.  Okay.  I've got to deal with you people all day.,s,s,dis
So what I need you to do is I need you to fill out this form correctly and go to the back of the line.,s,s,dis
"Okay, that's nice. That's nice but I have done everything you people have told me to do. I don't understand why you can't just help me get this done.  It's simple, right?  License.  I need it. Can we just do this please?",q,q,dis
There's nothing I can do for you.  Do you understand that?  Nothing.,s,ans,ang
"What I need you to do is go to the back of the line,",s,s,dis
I've been to the back of the line five times.,s,s,ang
fill out this form and wait,c,s,dis
You're going to have to go back again.,s,s,ang
Okay.  What is it that I did wrong on the form that I have to start all over again?,q,q,ang
and you filled out-,s,s,dis
"Okay.  Well, I can do that right here right now without going to the back of the line again.  See look initialed.  All done. Ready to go.",s,s,ang
Ma'am I have other people waiting in line right now.  I have other people waiting in line right now.,s,s,ang
I have been waiting for over an hour.,s,s,dis
This whole area of the form was not supposed to be filled out and you put the address in the wrong place,s,s,dis
"Uhh, and you spelled your own name wrong.  So I need you to take that",s,s,dis
I'm not starting over again.  No I have done this five times.  I am not starting over again.,s,dag,ang
"and, uh, throw it away. I need you to fill out a new form.",s,s,dis
Ma'am you're going to have- you- look. You really- you really,s,s,dis
Look can you not just help me?,q,q,dis
I mean look she's -she's perfectly nice.  She doesn't mind waiting for a couple of minutes because I've been here all day. I have a job to get back to.  I have kids to pick up from school.  I can't just stay here.,s,s,ang
like I said before right now.,s,s,ang
This is your job is to help people like me who need to get a new license.,o,o,ang
Ma'am you are testing my patience.  Do you understand me?,o,o,dis
You're testing my goddamn patience.,o,o,ang
I'm testing your patience?,q,q,ang
"I work in this fucking building all day. And I'm sick of it, okay?",o,o,ang
I don't need to be.  I need to go and do other things with my time.  Okay.,s,s,ang
"Please just put the form in, take the picture, let me get my license and get the hell out of here.  Please.",c,c,ang
So you're leaving tomorrow.,q,q,sad
Yeah.  They just called.,ans,ans,sad
This is really-this is unfair.,o,o,sad
I know.,ag,ag,sad
I don't see [BREATHING],s,s,dis
I don't know what to say.  I don't want to go but I don't have a lot of choice.,o,o,sad
"I mean we both knew that this was going to happen.  It's just that I feel that, you know, I don't want Susie growing up without a mother.",o,o,dis
"And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back.",o,o,sad
I'm going to come back.  I need you to believe that.,dag,dag,sad
You don't know that.,s,o,dis
"I'll believe it, but- I'll believe it but it- I don't know that that's going to happen.",ans,ans,dis
Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.,o,o,sad
Do you think I want to leave you?,q,q,sad
You have a choice.,ans,ans,dis
I have to do this.  I don't want to leave.  Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up?,q,q,sad
I know.  It's just you don't have to do this for a living you know.,ag,ans,dis
You're a smart person.  There are other things you can do.,o,o,dis
Look we both knew what this meant when I signed on,s,s,dis
And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.,s,o,sad
I mean I'm the one who has to leave here.  I'm the one who has to leave the two of you.  At least you get to be together.,s,s,dis
What's that supposed to mean?,q,q,sad
I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here.,ans,ans,sad
Well I'll come back.  What is that supposed to mean?  You're not willing to wait for me to come back?,q,q,ang
Of course I'm going to wait.  I just- I just don't like the idea of this happening because this isn't the last time this is going to happen. You're going to go on more tours and stuff.  I just- I can't-,ans,ans,dis
I can't deal with this emotionally.,o,o,dis
What do you want me to do?,q,q,dis
I want you to leave.  I want you to leave the service.,ans,ans,dis
Well I can't very well do it today.  I still have to leave tomorrow.,o,o,dis
You can do it today.  You don't have to do anything.  You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.,dag,dag,dis
"You're not making this any easier for me, you know.  I'm the one who has to go and you're really not helping.",o,o,dis
Look I'm just telling you that you don't have to go.,s,s,dis
I do have to go. And I need to know that you're here waiting for me and that you believe that I'm coming back.,dag,dag,dis
That's all I'm saying... No you don't.,dag,dag,ang
Thanks that helps.,g,g,ang
It's just really unfair.  This is- this is bullshit.,o,o,dis
I feel much better now.,o,o,ang
"You're acting like, you know, you're the one who's going all through, you know, all this shit and it's really- it's really not.",o,o,ang
I know I'm leaving you here with all the responsibility but at least you get to be with her.,o,o,dis
Yeah.  Of course I do because I didn't enlist in this stupid thing.  Why don't you just get out now and then-,ag,ag,ang
I will but I can't right now.,s,s,dis
Then go.  We'll be here when you get back.,s,ag,dis
That's how you want to leave it?,q,q,ang
"I don't know how else to leave it.  What, do you want me to lie to you?",q,q,sad
You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?,q,q,sad
I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be.  I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here.,ans,ans,sad
Well I can't be okay with it the same way you can't not go.  It just doesn't work that way.,o,o,sad
Fine.,ans,b,sad
It's really exciting.  Don't you want to guess?,q,q,hap
"Uh, you got a new car, a new house. Uh, a dog.",ans,ans,neu
Look.,c,c,hap
Are you serious?  You're getting married.,q,q,sur

We're going to get married in the middle of a meadow. [LAUGHTER],s,s,hap

Why not browns?,q,q,neu
"It's a light brown, tanish.",s,s,neu
I just think browns are really what you want to go with.  I mean I think there's more contrast between brown and green than there is-,o,o,neu
I know but you just asked me to-,ans,ans,neu
"Come on.  Please will you do the greens and browns, just the browns for me?",q,q,dis
Okay.  Fine.  So green and what?,q,q,neu
Blue?,q,q,neu

Greens and blues and maybe a little light yellow?,q,q,neu
Yeah?,q,q,neu

"Okay.  That sounds good. Um, and, uh, we're going to get like a five, uh, story cake, right?",q,q,neu
"I mean, you know, you're going to have at least, like, two hundred and fifty people come.  So we're going to need, you know, just a huge buffet.",s,o,neu
Yes.,ans,ag,hap
"Fried chicken, mashed potatoes.",s,s,neu
because you're going to take care of everything.  You're going to think of all the details that I forget.,o,o,hap
Well I can't be in charge of this.  I mean I got things I got to do.,dag,dag,neu
Well this is really exciting.  I mean- I just- I couldn't be happier right now.,o,o,hap
I'm thrilled.  God.,o,o,hap

I know.  I've been waiting forever.  I can't believe it's finally happening.,o,o,hap
Wow.  I just- I- I- I feel like I'm going to faint.,o,o,hap
I'm so- all the blood,o,o,hap
You don't look like you're going to faint.,o,o,hap
"has just rushed to my head, and I, and I mean honestly.",o,o,hap
I'm getting a little weak in the knees.,o,o,hap
So- So when are you getting married Mr. Excited?,q,q,hap

You really like,s,s,hap
"I don't know.  Okay.  I mean gosh.  There's just- look there's a lot of pressure in getting married, okay.",o,o,neu
You could make her that excited.  You really like her.  You guys have been together for a really long time now.,o,o,hap
[LAUGHTER] That's more than I needed to know.,s,o,hap
[laughter],oth,oth,hap
That's helpful.,o,o,neu
I just don't think I can do this anymore.  It's been a really long time and it's not like I'm not trying.,o,o,dis
Well I guess you're not trying hard enough.,o,o,neu
I am try-  it's been three years,s,dag,dis
and I have gone everywhere I can think of.  I have given resumes.  I have done interviews.  I've tried to pull in favors.  I've asked everybody I know for help.  I don't know what else to do.,s,s,dis
"Just, I don't know, maybe you're not smart enough.",o,o,neu
I mean I don't know just go out and keep trying. Just-,o,o,neu
I don't know.,s,o,neu
"Okay but I've been trying for three years.  Three years and I haven't gotten a bite much less actually gotten hired, and I am smart enough.  Thank you very much.",s,s,dis
"Hey.  Look, I mean- you know.",s,c,neu
I'm really good at what I do.  I just don't know how to make someone else see that.,o,o,ang
Look bananas don't grow overnight.  Okay.,o,o,neu
What?  Who says that?  Bananas don't grow overnight.,q,q,ang
You need that- Time-,s,s,neu
"You know- You need to just- you need, I mean it takes time to get a good job.  I mean-",o,o,neu
Okay.  I think three years is a little excessive.,o,o,dis
"look at me, like, you know. I mean, Hey, I- it took me, you know, like six years to get where I am now. I mean-",s,s,neu
"Yeah but you weren't unemployed for three years trying to find any job.  I mean at this point I'm going to go drive a cab or, you know, work at the gas station or something.  I don't even- I don't know what to do anymore.",o,s,ang
I don't know.  I mean whatever.,s,s,dis
Nothing I'm trying seems to work. Just-,s,s,dis
Clearly everything you're doing is completely wrong.,o,o,ang
"I mean, well I mean i don't know; it doesn't really affect my life, you know.",o,o,neu
Well don't you understand that this is-,q,q,dis
"Yeah, I understand, but-",ag,ans,neu
I don't even- I mean you have to have some kind of an idea.  Something you could possibly throw out there that I could maybe use.,o,o,ang
"I don't know. Well like, I don't know. I mean-",s,s,neu
I mean it's not like this is an,o,o,ang
extreme request.  I want to find a job.  Everybody wants to find a job. It's really not that.,o,o,ang
Clearly- cle- clearly you're doing something wrong.,o,o,neu
"Okay. Okay, Fine.",ag,ag,ang
"Cause if you've been looking, you've been applying for jobs for three years. And-",s,s,neu
Okey So I'm doing something wrong.  What am I doing wrong?,q,q,ang
I'm really good at what I do.  I'm smart.  I'm trained.  I have the education.  I'm talented.  I cannot-,o,o,ang
Are you- I mean do you like get dressed up and everything when you go to the job interview?,q,q,neu
Well yeah I mean I like take a shower and stuff.,ans,ans,dis
"And you like- you know, you shave your legs and everything?",q,q,neu
[LAUGHTER] Yeah.  Usually.,ans,ans,dis
"and I want- I mean you know you've got to, like, do your hair.  I mean- I don't know, it's like,",s,q,neu
"Yeah, I- I make my",ans,ans,dis
I make myself very presentable before I go to any kind of interview.,s,s,dis
"you know what I mean? You know, it's like they say presentation is, like eighty percent.",s,o,neu
or some- some large percent of- of success.,s,s,neu
"Uhuh. Uhuh. Yeah, yeah. Good quote.",ag,o,dis
"Because I don't know I mean just, you know, just keep- keep- keep at it.  Keep trying.  Go-",o,o,neu
Buck-O. That's really helpful.  Just keep chugging along.  The little engine that could.,o,o,dis
Well you- just you're doing something wrong.,s,s,ang
"Look if I could give you a job,if I could give you a job I would but I mean I'm not in that position. I'm-",o,o,dis
Well maybe you could help.  I mean you've got a job.  I'm willing to look outside of my realm.  I could try something else.,o,o,dis
"Hey, I'd love to help you but I- you don't have the kind of training that I-",o,o,neu
I'll get it.  I just need a job.  I don't care what it is.,o,s,dis
"So, go to McDonalds.",o,o,dis
Well I mean I need to make a little bit more than the minimum wage fry flipper.,o,o,dis
Well you've got to start somewhere.  I mean-,o,o,neu
I did start somewhere.  I worked my way up.  I'm not going to start at the bottom again.,o,s,dis
Well you're going to have to.  You don't really have an option.  What's your problem?,q,q,dis
What's my problem?  What's my problem? I don't have a job.,ans,ans,ang
I don't know it's like I'm trying to be-,s,s,neu
I thought I was pretty clear about what the problem was.,o,o,ang
I'm trying to be helpful.,o,o,neu
Well maybe you could be a little helpful.  I mean obviously you don't have any problems so would it really take so much time out of your day to just go ahead and help somebody else.,o,o,dis
I'm trying to watch TV.,s,s,neu
That's important.  That's really important.,o,o,dis
Where?  Did you do it at the front desk or by the baggage claims?,q,q,dis
"I-I don't know.  The place where they told me to go.  Look they told me to come talk to you because you guys lost my bag.  Not it's late.  Not it will be here soon, lost it completely.  What are you going to do about that?",q,q,dis
"Ma'am, first of all I'd like you to calm down.  Second of all-",ans,ans,dis
Look that bag has my entire life in it and you just lost it.,s,s,dis
"Lost it just, like, I mean,",s,s,ang
"Ma'am, I understand that.",ag,ag,dis
it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention,o,o,ang
"because my bag was very easy to keep track of.  It's got big, you know, rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it's just gone.",s,s,ang
"I understand that.  The best I can do for you, at this moment, is give you fifty dollar check courtesy of Northwest Airlines for inconveniencing you in losing your luggage.",s,s,dis
Wait.  What?,q,q,sur
"At this moment in time, all I can do for you is give you-",ans,ans,dis
No. No. I heard- I heard what you said.,s,s,ang
"You're kidding me, right.  You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through.  I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up.",s,s,ang
you're getting very excited right now,o,o,dis
"Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it.",s,ag,ang
"I understand that, ma'am but there's not really much I can do for you right now.",s,s,dis
Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.,s,s,ang
What I need you to do is file another complaint form. There's a form that you can fill out over by the front desk near the baggage claim.,s,s,dis
If you'd like to take that over to the front desk- Ma'am.,s,s,dis
We're just talking over each other.,s,s,dis
We're not going to communicate anything this way.,s,s,dis
I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it.,o,o,ang
Ma'am in flying with Northwest Airlines you agreed to,s,s,dis
sign away your luggage to the,s,s,dis
I didn't sign anything. I didn't sign anything. And you people have got to make-,dag,dag,ang
"It's part of the small- it's part of the agreement when you're purchasing an airline ticket, there's- when you-",ans,s,dis
You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff.  Fifty dollars is unacceptable.,s,s,ang
"Ma'am, please calm down.  When you purchase a ticket, there is a terms and agreement,",s,s,dis
No.  No.  I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what?  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option.,o,o,ang
terms and conditions- in the agreement of purchasing a ticket. Most people frequently look it over,s,s,dis
The best that we can do for you is give you-,s,s,dis
Ma'am.,b,b,dis
I want to talk to your supervisor.,s,s,ang
I am- I am- I am my own supervisor.,s,s,dis
"I've had enough.  I want to talk to-no, no unacceptable I want to your supervisor. I am done with this.",s,c,ang
"I am the supervisor, ma'am.",s,s,dis
"Really, you don't work for anybody.  It's just you?",q,q,ang
I am the current manager on duty.,s,ans,dis
"Okay.  Well I want to call whoever you report to, whoever your boss is because I have had enough with this airline and I am finished waiting for my fifty dollar gift certificate.",o,o,ang
"Ma'am, I own Northwest Airlines.",s,s,dis
"Hey, I'm, uh. I'm really sorry about what happened.  I don't um- I mean what you can you do?  I mean it's-",ap,ap,sad
Thanks.,g,g,sad
Mmhmm. Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean it's- it's hard.  It's hard.,ag,ag,sad
"I just- I just thought he would have longer, you know, because I'm- I mean when he found out he was sick, we knew that wasn't good but I just- I just thought that it would take longer, you know?",o,o,sad
Yeah.,ag,ag,sad
"Well I mean, you know, I mean it was I mean with that kind of condition,",s,s,neu
Yeah. I know. I know.,ag,ag,sad
"you know, it's inevitable  and I mean honestly it's- it's almost like",o,o,sad
"you know, you don't- you know, how long do you want the person to go through that, you know.",o,o,neu
It's sort of- it's almost better off to rest in peace than he is to live in pain.,o,o,neu
"Yeah, I know. But I'd rather have him here with me, you know. It's just not fair.  I mean he- he didn't get to do like anything. I mean he was-",o,o,sad
"He was only twenty four and just so many things that we were going to do, you know, and now he won't get to do them and he won't get to be here when I do.  You know, like I'll get married some day and he won't be there, like, he won't get to see that.",o,o,sad
Yeah.,ag,ag,sad
It just doesn't seem fair.,o,o,sad
"It's not fair but I mean that's, you know, the course of life is that, you know, you meet people and you lose them.",o,o,sad
You're okay,ag,q,sad
Thank you for being here.,g,a,sad
You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted.,o,o,sad
[LAUGHTER] You're probably right.  He probably would be pissed if we were all sitting around being upset about it. He'd want us to have a party.,ag,ag,hap
Yeah.,ag,ag,neu
And to drink in his honor. [LAUGHTER],s,s,hap
"That's right.  That's right.  I mean he would want us to, you know, celebrate the life that he- that he lived and, you know, enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can.",o,o,sad
"Yeah, I know.",ag,ag,sad
So-,s,s,sad
"Hey, what's up?",q,q,neu
Guess what came today?,q,q,hap

Big bad acceptance packet with all the information.  I'm going to U.S.C..,s,s,hap
That's amazing.  Wow.,o,o,hap

"[LAUGHTER] Yeah, uh. No.",dag,dag,hap
[LAUGHTER] It's safe around there.,o,s,hap
The campus is beautiful. I'm so excited.,o,o,hap
I know but you should get like a taser or something.  I mean walking around the campus at night-,ag,ag,neu
"Do you want to buy me some mace for my, you know, going away present?",q,q,hap
There we go.  Perfect.,o,o,hap
And a taser.  Excellent.  Just make sure it's a big knife.,o,o,hap
I don't want any of those little puny ones.,o,o,hap
"So, um- so what are you going to- what are you going to major in?",q,q,neu
Well I was thinking maybe underwater basket weaving.,ans,ans,hap
"U.S.C. has a major in that, right.",s,s,hap
They have - U.S.C. has everything because U.S.C. is the best school ever.,ans,ans,hap
they have that as a major?,q,q,neu
That's ridiculous.  I don't believe that.,o,o,neu
Okay.  Well I'm lying but-,s,ag,hap
"Seriously, what's your major?",q,q,neu
"Well, I haven't decided yet.  I want to try some things out.",ans,ans,hap
So you're undecided?,q,q,neu
"Hey, that's cool.",o,o,neu
"No, no.  It's totally cool.  I mean, like, this friend of mine he was- he's been undecided now for, like, the past like eleven years of his life.",o,o,neu
okay.  Well I'm not going to be undecided forever. [LAUGHTER],o,o,hap
"Uh, well-",b,b,neu
And it's so close so you can come visit me all the time.,o,o,hap
You- you- you'll find.,s,s,neu
"So this works out perfectly.  Because I was worried if I didn't get in to U.S.C., then I would have to go somewhere far away and then-",o,o,hap
"You'd have to, like go somewhere else, and, you know, we would be apart, and that would suck.",o,o,neu
Everything worked out perfectly.,o,o,hap
That's awesome.,o,o,hap
I know.  We should have a party.,ag,ag,hap
An I got accepted to U.S.C. party.,s,s,hap
No.  An I got accepted to U.S.C. party. [LAUGHTER],ans,ans,hap
"Oh, that's right. Okay, I see. Right, right, right.",ag,ag,neu
A party celebrating your acceptance.,s,s,neu
Right.  Now you're with me.,ag,ag,hap
That's cool.,o,o,neu
That is why I got accepted.,ans,o,hap
"Well, that's really cool that you're going to be staying in the same city and everything. so umm",o,o,hap
I know.,ag,ag,hap
"I don't know are you, like, I don't know.  Are you, like, available or anything?",q,q,neu
"Well I mean I don't know.  It's like you know I kind of had a crush on you throughout high school and, like",ans,ans,hap
"I don't know I just thought that, you know, maybe we could, you know, I don't know.  It's like, you know, just test the waters anyway.  I don't see what the problem is.",o,o,hap
What- what did you have in mind?,q,q,hap
"Movies- movie, we'll go to a movie and a dinner and- and",s,ans,hap
"actually, you know, there's this- there's this really cool restaurant, um, I don't know if you-  it's Red Lobster.  It's like down on",s,s,hap
[LAUGHTER],oth,oth,hap
Vermont.,s,s,hap

On occasion I've heard of it.,ans,ans,hap
"Oh, so well then you know that it's awesome.",q,q,hap
Yeah.  Totally.,ag,ans,hap
"Right, so we'll go there and then- and then we'll get some ice cream and maybe we'll go putt-putt golfing.",s,s,hap
I am totally down with the ice cream.,s,o,hap
Okay.  Putt-putt golfing?,q,q,neu
"Eh, we can work that part out.",ans,ans,hap
"Yeah, you want to go.  No, you want to go. You want to go.",o,o,hap
Alright.,ag,ag,hap
I can see it in your eyes.  You want to go.,o,o,hap
party.,s,s,hap
Good. Alright we're so happy.,o,o,hap
"That's right.  Um, so U.S.C. is a really nice school.",s,s,hap
I know.,ag,ag,hap
Are you going to take out loans or-,q,q,neu
Okay well that's not a happy part.  We don't want to talk about that.,ans,ans,hap
"Well no.  I mean I have some scholarships and some financial aid and stuff but I'll have to, you know, I'll get a job",s,s,hap
while I'm in school.  It'll be good.,s,s,hap
Yeah.  It will work out.  Maybe I could work at Red Lobster.,o,o,hap
I know.  Right down the street.,ag,ag,hap
"But, um-",b,b,neu
"I mean, like, I don't know.  I'm just saying if you need to make some extra cash.  You can, you know",s,s,neu
Or library.,o,o,neu
I just said the library,s,s,neu
"or, um, campus cruiser.  You can drive people around.",ans,o,neu
Excellent.  Drive drunk people around because you know that's all campus cruisers for.,o,o,hap
Right or you can run for student counsel.,o,o,neu
"Okay.  No, that's dorky.",o,dag,hap
Dorky?,q,q,neu
Yeah.,ag,ans,hap
It's important.,o,o,neu
Student counsel?,q,q,hap
"No, it's dorky.",dag,dag,hap
Fine.  It's dorky.,ag,ag,neu
Social life.  Hello.,s,s,hap
But that'll fit you  because you're a dork.,o,o,neu
[LAUGHTER].,oth,oth,hap
[LAUGHTER].,oth,oth,hap
I dork.,s,s,hap
"No.  But I'm thinking I might, you know, like audition for a play or something.  I don't really want to do the sorority thing.  I'm not really feeling that vibe with the",o,o,hap
"Yeah, you don't want to do the sorority thing because you'll probably get used and abused by",o,o,neu
lots of drunk frat boys,o,o,neu
Yeah.,ag,ag,neu
What have you heard about the Greek system?,q,q,hap
"I mean it's not really free because you have to pay for it, but yeah.",o,o,neu
Well do you think you're going to live on campus or off campus your first year?,q,q,neu
"I hate to break this to you but you meet people by being cool, so-",o,o,neu
"Oh, oh, I'm sorry, my bad.  I'll have to, like, sign up for summer lessons from you before I go.  You can teach me how to be cool before I go to college.",o,o,hap
"No, no, no.  You're right though.  I mean, you know, dorms are definitely the way to meet people.  I know that I was in an apartment off campus",ag,ag,neu
"that happened, you know, that was going on.",s,s,neu
That's what you're saying. I'm right. [LAUGHTER],s,s,hap
me.,s,s,hap
"Sir, can- can you tell me which branch you went to.  We can start there.",q,q,neu
"Okay.  Um, and what was the complaint?",q,q,neu
The food was prepared incorrectly.,ans,ans,dis
I asked for no tomatoes.,s,s,dis
"Can you be a little more specific, sir?",q,q,neu
"Did you try to take them back and get your order fixed, sir?",q,q,dis
"Well I'm very sorry, sir.  They should have dealt with it at that particular branch.  I apologize for that, uh, but we can help you.  That's no worries.  We can take care of that.  So how much did you need to be refunded?",q,ap,neu
"It was a hundred a sixty dollars.  I'm sorry, uh, sixteen dollars.",s,s,neu
"Okay.  Um, I'm going to go ahead and transfer you over to another department.  They'll need your address.",s,s,neu
"Look, I don't want to be transferred over to another- All I want to do is just give you my name and address so you can send me a check.",ans,dag,ang
"Okay.  You understand that's all I want. Just don't give me a problem with this.  Okay, please because I'm very sensitive right now",s,s,ang
"and if I get sent to another operator, I'll have to tell them the same damn story again.  I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind.  So if you could please just not do that, that would be great.  Thank you.",o,o,ang
"I understand, sir.  I will explain to them what the situa-",s,s,dis
You don't understand because you've never gone to Del Taco and gotten the service that I've gotten.  You don't understand.,dag,dag,ang
You're not going to call the other operator. You're not going to call the the other operator.,c,s,ang
You're going to fill out a form on your desk,s,s,ang
because I know you're at a desk right now in your stupid corporate building and you're going to send me a check for sixteen dollars and forty two cents.,s,s,ang
"Okay, sir.  They- they have to-",s,s,dis
Sir.,b,b,dis
"Sir, they have to take down your address at the other station.  I will transfer.  I will explain everything to them.  It will all be fine.  I promise.",s,s,dis
What's your name?,q,q,dis
Cindy?,ans,ans,dis
Cindy?  Cindy what?,q,q,ang
"Sir, I don't think my name is really relevant-",ans,ans,dis
"Cindy, look.  If you don't get your ass a piece of paper that has a check",s,s,ang
"attached to it and you don't send it to me, I'm going to get very upset.",o,o,ang
"Alright, sir. Sir.  I'm going to transfer you to the address.",s,s,dis
"Alright.  You know what, sir.  The customer is always right.",ag,ag,dis
"You know what.  I- You know what? You know what? No, it's fine. it's fine it's fine You know what?",s,s,dis
I will go ahead and I will take- I will take,s,s,dis
"Hey, Cindy. Cindy, look I know this is not your fault.  Do whatever you want.",s,s,dis
Send me to whatever operator. I just- You know what?  I'm just done.  I'm just done.  I've lost all hope.,o,o,dis
"of getting my sixteen dollars back. It fine, no honestly.",o,o,dis
"No, Cindy just don't even-look don't even.  Cuz I- look Cindy I know you don't care about me, okay.  I know that I'm just like another person who calls-",s,s,dis
But I'm giving you what you want.,s,s,ang
No it doesn't matter.  It's fine.  It's fine.  Just send me to the next operator.  That's fine.,s,s,dis
"Okay.  If that's what you want, you want to go to the next person?",q,q,dis
Okay.  Great.,a,a,dis
He saw it.,s,s,neu
Did you talk to him?,q,q,sad
"No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.",ans,ans,sad
What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.,o,o,dis
"I don't know the meaning of this, mom.  But I know one thing you made a terrible mistake with dad.",ans,ans,dis
What?,q,q,sur
"Being dishonest with him, that kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.",ans,ans,dis
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,q,q,ang
"What do you want to do, argue with him?",q,q,ang
I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.,ans,ans,ang
You can't say that to him.,ans,ans,ang
We've got to say it to him.,c,c,ang
How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?,q,q,ang
For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.,ans,ans,ang
To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?,q,q,ang
Sit down mom.  I want to talk to you.,c,c,dis
The trouble is the goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry.,s,s,ang
"Alright, alright, alright.  Listen. You know why I asked Annie here don't you?",q,q,dis
You know why.,q,ans,neu
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,ans,ans,neu
"Well that's only your business, Chris.",o,o,neu
You know it's not only my business.,dag,dag,dis
What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,o,o,ang
Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.,s,s,dis
Then it isn't just my business.,o,s,ang
I'm just saying.,s,s,dis
Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.,o,o,ang
Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.,o,o,ang
I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.,s,s,ang
She's not Larry's girl.,dag,dag,dis
"From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl.",s,s,ang
"Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?",q,q,ang
"I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life time after time after time.",o,o,dis
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.,o,o,neu
To hell with that.,dag,dag,ang
I wanted to get this settled first.,ans,ans,sad
How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.,q,q,dis
"Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.",ans,ans,dis
"and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me.",c,c,ang
The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,o,o,dis
So what I'm not fast with women.,s,ag,ang
I don't see why it has to be Annie.,s,s,ang
Because it is.,s,s,ang
Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.,s,s,ang
"These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",q,q,sad
"I don't want a diagram.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.",ans,ans,dis
You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?,q,q,ang
"I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry",s,s,ang
"and everything would be happy and we would have a regular wedding.  But if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.",s,s,dis
Are you crazy?,q,q,ang
You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?,q,q,ang
"The business, the business doesn't inspire me.",ans,ans,ang
Must you be inspired?,q,q,ang
"Yes, I like it an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening I want it beautiful.",ans,ans,dis
I want- I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I give myself to.  Annie is in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?,s,s,dis
You mean-tell me something you mean you'd really leave the business?,q,q,dis
Then you help me stay here.,c,c,dis
Alright but don't think that way,s,s,ang
"because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris.",s,s,ang
I know.  Just you help me stay here.,ag,ag,dis
But don't think that way.  You hear me?,q,q,ang
Yeah.  I can see that.,ag,s,ang
Why did he invite her?,q,q,ang
Why does that bother you?,q,q,neu
It's been three years.  Why all of a sudden?,q,q,ang
Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again.,ans,ans,neu
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,q,q,neu
Listen kid.,c,c,dis
"No, line.",dag,dag,ang
"Uh, Then why is she still-she's not his girl, Joe",o,o,neu
"She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",o,o,ang
Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.,ans,ans,ang
How do you know why she waited?,q,q,dis
Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.,ans,ans,ang
"In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",ans,o,dis
Look it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?,q,q,dis
"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might but not his father, not his brother.",o,o,dis
What do you want me to do?,q,q,dis
But Kate-,b,b,dis
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.",o,o,dis
"She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look, look at it.  Joe-",s,s,ang
Calm yourself.,c,c,dis
"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",s,s,dis
Calm yourself.,c,c,dis
Just last week a man showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.,s,s,dis
Alright.  Alright.  Calm yourself.,c,c,dis
You above all have got to believe.  You.,c,c,dis
Why me above all?,q,q,dis
Just don't stop believing.,ans,ans,dis
"What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking.",s,s,ang
I can't help it.,o,o,dis
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is matter with you Kate?,q,q,dis
What?,q,q,ang
I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.,ans,o,neu
I guess this is why I came.,o,o,hap
"Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",o,o,hap
I have no imagination that's all I know to tell you.,s,s,hap
I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I,s,s,hap
"Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.",s,s,hap
And he's gone forever.  You're sure?,q,q,neu
You started to write me.,ans,ans,hap
Every day since.,ans,ans,hap
"I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say.  I mean you sure can be ambiguous you know.",ans,ans,hap
"Give me a kiss, Ann.  Give me a-God I kissed you.",c,c,hap
"I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",o,o,hap
I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,o,o,hap
"Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",o,o,hap
"No, nothing like that.",ans,ans,sad
Yes.  I suppose I have been but it's going from me.,ans,ans,sad
I don't know where to start.,s,s,dis
There's so many things mixed up.,s,s,sad
You remember overseas I was in command of a company?,q,q,sad
"Yeah, sure.",ans,ans,neu
Well I lost them.,s,s,sad
How many?,q,q,sad
Just about all.,ans,ans,sad
It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.,o,o,sad
"For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.",s,s,sad
I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.,s,s,sad
They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.,o,o,sad
"And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made",o,o,sad
a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?,q,q,sad
And then I came home and it was amazing.,s,s,sad
"I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",s,s,sad
because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.,s,s,sad
"I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.",s,s,sad
"when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.",o,o,sad
Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.,o,o,sad
I guess that included you.,o,o,sad
"Annie, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.",o,o,hap
What'll I do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.,q,q,hap
Fine.,ans,ans,neu
"Is that, is that-that's just foam isn't it?  I can't even tell",s,s,hap
"Oh, no you know what I did?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid I forgot my flashlight.",s,s,dis
"The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?",ans,ans,dis
Well sure.,ag,ag,dis
"No of course our flashlight, yours and mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?",ans,ans,dis
I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon.  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?,q,q,hap
"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.",s,s,neu
"Ah, this is great, isn't it?  I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.",s,s,hap
It's after eleven let's go home.,s,s,ang
Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?,q,q,dis
There is no point in coming down here.,ans,ans,ang
Right.,ag,b,dis
That's my point.,s,s,dis
That's my point too.,ag,ag,neu
So let's go home.,c,c,dis
"No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?",q,q,dis
Not particularly.,ans,ans,dis
I just don't.  It's stupid.,ans,ans,ang
Honey this is natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year.  This is a great opportunity.,s,s,dis
Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.,s,s,hap
"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die.",s,s,ang
"Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that.",s,s,dis
This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.,o,o,hap
What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.,o,o,ang
"Yeah, they do.",dag,dag,dis
"Oh, Augie.",b,b,dis
Okay but it's fish who do something none of the other fish do,s,s,dis
"like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic",s,s,hap
a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you cannot be interested.,o,o,dis
I'm just not.,s,s,ang
For real?,q,q,sur
Yes.,ans,ans,ang
I don't get it.  The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.,s,s,dis
We weren't in a good spot.,o,o,dis
We didn't see them the first time either.,s,s,ang
We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.,o,o,ang
"I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there. What's that.  Is that?  Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it.",q,q,hap
"Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.",c,c,hap
Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.,s,s,hap
No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.,s,s,hap
They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.,s,s,hap
It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.,o,o,hap
They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place,s,s,hap
where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.,s,s,hap
"Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.",s,s,hap
That's the wind.,s,s,dis
About what?,q,q,ang
It's ridiculous.,o,o,ang
"Well, so what do you think?",q,q,neu
It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,o,o,ang
Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.,ans,ans,ang
Well then what's bugging you?,q,q,dis
We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.,ans,ans,ang
"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",s,s,dis
"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",s,o,ang
Why not?,q,q,dis
We totally skipped. Right.,ans,ans,neu
"For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.",o,o,ang
Why not?,q,q,dis
We never do.  Do we have we ever?,q,q,ang
We've missed them twice that's not ever.,ans,ans,dis
Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.,s,s,ang
We'll see them this year.,o,o,dis
and the fish won't show up.,o,s,ang
I thought you wanted to see it.,o,o,dis
You don't understand anything I'm saying.,s,s,dis
"No, of course not.",dag,dag,dis
I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is.,o,o,dis
It's just a fish.  Nothing to get traumatized over.,o,o,dis
I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.  You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.,s,s,dis
We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes,s,s,sad
"and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me",s,s,sad
right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.,s,s,sad
"And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",s,s,sad
Wait a minute.  I've got it.,c,c,neu
"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.",s,s,sad
"It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?",q,q,neu
"That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it.",ans,ans,hap
I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.,ans,o,sad
No.,ans,ans,neu
You want me to get some champagne?,q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,sad
No.  No.,ans,ans,dis
Well what?  Want me to breath in your ear?,q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,dis
Want to get married again?,q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,dis
What?  What do you want a divorce?,q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,dis
A vacation?,q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,ang
"A new carpet, a poodle, a backrub, ice cream, a suicide pact.  What?  What?  Carla what the hell do you want?",q,q,dis
"Do you think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish.",q,q,dis
Do you think that I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex and times I would look at you and think holy hell when's the next flight to Alaska.,q,q,dis
"No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our",o,o,dis
"Sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha, ha baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get,",o,o,dis
"This what, what is this?  This isn't even anything.",s,s,ang
"Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",o,o,ang
I'm doing the best I can.,ans,ans,dis
"I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",ag,ag,sad
Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,o,o,sad
I didn't say that.,dag,dag,dis
"No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy.",ag,ag,sad
"For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.",o,o,dis
Yeah?,q,q,sur
Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else,ans,ans,dis
somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.,o,o,sad
"Actually now that you mention it, no I don't.",dag,dag,neu
I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.,o,o,neu
"Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon.",o,o,hap
Well look at what we got here.,s,s,hap
"Oh, Augie you brought refreshments.",s,s,hap
It's not champagne.,s,s,neu
Well then I guess we don't need glasses.,s,s,hap
I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this may be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry.,ans,ans,hap
I wonder.,ans,ans,fea
It must be them then.,s,s,fea
Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine.,s,s,hap
What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,q,q,hap
Behave exquisitely.,ans,ans,hap
With the most perfect poise.,q,s,hap
Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.,ans,ag,hap
"Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?",q,q,hap
"Don't say that, my darling.",c,c,neu
It's true the whole business is very poor joke.,o,o,hap
Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,c,c,hap
Who's they?,q,q,neu
"Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours?",q,q,hap
Well who knows?,ans,ans,neu
What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left still laugh?,q,q,neu
"Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",o,o,hap
Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?,q,q,neu
Which particular one?,q,q,hap
The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.,ans,ans,neu
"Oh, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles he did wriggle so beautifully.",s,s,hap
Horrible thing.  I hated it.,o,o,neu
"Yes, I know you did.  You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.",ag,ag,hap
How long did that row last?,q,q,neu
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.,s,s,neu
It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,s,s,hap
Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,s,s,hap
"How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",o,o,hap
And very much sillier.,o,o,hap
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",s,s,neu
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,s,s,ang
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,s,s,ang
You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,s,s,ang
What of it?,b,q,ang
What of it?,b,b,ang
What about me?,q,q,ang
"That's a nice point of view, I must say.",o,o,ang
"Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.",o,o,dis
No thanks.,ans,ans,dis
"I'll have some myself, I think.",s,s,neu
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on.,o,o,dis
It's become a habit with you.,o,o,ang
"Oh, don't be so stupid.",o,o,ang
"Really, Amanda.",dag,dag,ang
What?,q,q,ang
Nothing.,ans,ans,ang
"Going somewhere, my dear?",q,q,ang
Just making myself fascinating for you.,ans,ans,dis
The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute will you.,o,o,dis
"Oh, no it isn't",dag,dag,dis
It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,o,o,ang
"Snap, snap, snap like a little adder.",o,o,dis
Adders don't snap they sting.,dag,dag,ang
They sting.,dag,dag,ang
"I don't care, okay.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.",o,o,ang
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,q,q,neu
"Yes, I did quite a lot.",ans,ans,ang
Mind your own business.,c,c,ang
You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.,o,o,ang
I'm not in the least drunk.,dag,dag,ang
You always had a weak head.,o,o,ang
I think I mentioned once before that I had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.,o,o,dis
"On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",o,o,ang
"Oh, shut up.",c,c,ang
"Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.",o,o,ang
Very good idea.  I will.,ag,ag,ang
Why?,q,q,ang
There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,s,s,ang
There are people downstairs I suppose.,q,q,ang
This is no time of year for Tunis.,o,o,ang
Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,dag,dag,ang
Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,c,c,ang
You're far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,o,o,ang
"Go away, go away.  I hate you.",c,c,ang
"Amanda, listen.",c,c,ang
Listen? Listen indeed.  I'm sick and tired of listening to you.  You damn sadistic bully.,o,o,ang
Stop.,c,c,ang
Very amusing.,dag,o,ang
"Stop, stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",o,o,ang
"You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast. And I hope I never see you again as long as I live.",o,o,ang
"This is the end do you understand?  The end,",s,s,ang
You're not going like this.,c,c,ang
finally and forever,s,s,ang
"Oh, I am.  Let go of me.",dag,dag,ang
You're not.,dag,dag,ang
"Oh, I hate you. It's a good thing that I found out in time what you're really like. Marry you again?  Never, never, never.",o,o,ang
Shut up.  Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.,s,s,ang
"You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore.",o,o,ang
I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine.,o,o,ang
"Yeah, hi.  Um, look, I -- all I'm trying to do right now is renew my license plate.  That's all.  I just need to get one of those little stickers.",s,s,neu
Okay.  What's the problem?,q,q,neu
"And I've- I've- some lady -- I got in line.  I waited for about two hours um, and, I gave her this form",ans,ans,dis
"that she gave to me earlier. And she said oh, I gave you the wrong one by accident.  So I was hoping I could just fill out a new one, give it to you and sort of skip this whole line business.",s,s,dis
"Okay, um.  Do you have your photo ID with you?",q,q,neu
"Yes, I do.",ans,ans,neu
Okay.  This is the wrong form.  I'm sorry.,s,s,neu
"This is -- okay, then just can I have the form that I need.",q,q,dis
"I don't have the form.  You're going to have to go get in that line over there and they will give you the right form.  And after you fill it out, you can bring it back to me.",ans,ans,dis
Don't you -- you don't have-,q,s,dis
are you telling me you don't have a stack of them behind the desk?,q,q,dis
I don't have any of,ans,ans,dis
I don't have any of them over here.  You're gonna have to go get in that line over there.  And they will give you a copy of the form.,s,s,dis
"But you're -- it's the same -- I mean, you can -- like I can't go behind your desk--",s,s,dis
"Nope, I don't. I don't have-",dag,dag,dis
or I can't go behind there- you can go behind this person's desk and just grab the form. So if you could just do that; that would help me out a lot.,s,s,dis
"No, I can't. That's-",dag,dag,dis
I'm sorry.  You have to do things the way you have to do things here.  We have rules.,s,s,dis
"Look, can you please just-- --make this -- look, I look--",q,c,dis
"Go get in that-- Sir-- Sir, there are people in line behind you. you need",s,s,dis
look-- It's  been- it's been two hours.  Can you please just make this easier on me and just go and get the form?  It's not- it's really not,q,q,dis
"I'm sorry.  I'm sorry you're having a hard time,",ap,ap,dis
but you're gonna have to go get in  that line to,s,s,dis
What if I pay you money?,q,q,dis
"Can I pay you money?  Can I give you, like, twenty bucks and you'll go back there and get the form?",q,q,dis
twenty bucks? Please. Go get in that line over there.,ans,ans,neu
"Come on.  Will you please?  I just --I look, I  cannot-- --just if I --",q,q,dis
"Look, I'm having a really bad day.  I'm off in twenty minutes and I just really don't need this right now, okay.",s,s,dis
"I don't care, well- You're having a bad -- I just waited in line for two hours.",s,s,dis
"And you're gonna have to go wait again, because that's the line you need.",s,s,dis
I can't do that. It's against our rules. You can go get in that line over there or you can just go ahead and leave and come back another day.  Maybe there will be a shorter line.,o,o,dis
That's all I- I just- That's all i want you to-,s,s,dis
"Rules, you just have to grab a piece of paper behind from somebody's desk",s,s,dis
It's not rocket science.,o,o,ang
"Come -- just, please, just grab the form.  It's right over there.",s,s,dis
I can't do that.,dag,dag,dis
Why are you being such a bitch?,q,q,dis
"I'm sorry, but I can't do that.",ap,ap,dis
"Please, will you please -- will you please just grab the form?",q,q,dis
So go get in the other line or leave.  Or I will have you escorted out by security.,s,s,ang
Would you like to be kicked out of the D.M.V.?  You don't think that'll be a little embarrassing?,q,q,ang
"Fine, which line is it?",q,q,dis
The one you just came from.,ans,ans,dis
"Okay, fine.  I'll go over there.  Thanks, a lot.  You've been really helpful.",o,o,ang
Yeah.  Thank you.  Have a pleasant day.,g,g,ang
There's nothing I --,s,ans,dis
You're just going to pick up and leave me and our baby and miss a year of our lives?,q,q,dis
"It's -- look, it's only a year.  It'll go by quickly.  Okay.",ans,ans,dis
"I know, but I'll be back then.  And - and- and we'll have -- we have the rest of our lives.",ag,ag,dis
I can't do that.  I have to go.,dag,dag,dis
"Do you want to -- do you want to leave us behind?  I mean, I don't understand why you have to do this.",q,q,dis
I've made a pledge.  I can't not do this at this point.,s,ans,dis
I'm not going to stay more than a year.  I've  agreed to a year,ans,ans,dis
Then why do you have to go a year at all?,q,q,dis
Well unagree.  Tell them that you can't leave right now.  I can't do this by myself.  I can't do this without you.,c,c,dis
"Yes, you can.  Yes, you can.  You know you can.  You're a strong person.",dag,dag,dis
It is. It is. It is. It is. I'm going to write you every day.,dag,ag,dis
What else can we do?  I -- we don't have a choice in this.  Do you understand?  You can't come with me and I can't stay here.  That's all there is to it.,o,ans,dis
"There has to be something.  I mean, we can't just live with this.  It's not -- it just won't work this way.",o,o,dis
We don't have a choice.  I have to do this.,dag,dag,dis
Just tell them no.,c,c,dis
"I can't do it.  I'd love to.  I mean, I don't - if you understand, I don't want to stay.",dag,dag,dis
"I mean, I don't want to -- I don't want to leave.  I want to stay here with you.",o,o,dis
"Then, can't you please try something?  If you go and ask them and they say no, then I would understand, but you're not even willing to ask.",q,o,dis
Can't you just make an effort?  Can't you just try?,q,q,dis
I've asked already.  I can't go back.,ans,ans,dis
"It can't happen.  I have to go.  I want to stay really bad, but I can't.  There's just no -- I don't have an option.",o,o,dis
When do you leave?,q,q,sad
Next week.,ans,ans,dis
A week.  You're giving me a week to be okay with this.,ans,q,ang
"You can't make it out like I'm happy about this.  I mean, I didn't -- I didn't want to put you in this situation.",o,ans,dis
Well it doesn't seem like you're that bothered by it.,o,o,dis
"I am.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know what else to tell -- you know, I mean, I can tell you.  I don't know what else to do. I mean, I've been forced into this situation.",s,dag,dis
"If you really cared so much, you'd find a way out.",o,o,dis
There's nothing I can do.  I-- I,s,s,dis
They won't let you come along.  It's not going to happen.,dag,dag,dis
"It's a free world.  I can go where I want.  Wherever you are, that's where we're going to go.",o,o,dis
Are you kidding? Please don't be difficult about this.,q,q,dis
[BREATHING],oth,oth,dis
"I'm finding a way to make it work.  And I will go wherever you go.  Whatever I have to do, I will make this work.",o,o,dis

"Oh, my God.  How long have you been planning on doing this?",q,q,hap
"Honestly, it was kind of quickly.  It was actually only in the past couple months.",ans,ans,hap
I can't believe this.  You're getting married. It's crazy!,o,o,hap

Okay. Well there you go.,s,a,hap
"Oh, my God, where -- have you guys talked about where you're going to get married or--",q,q,hap

I'm so excited for you. That's great. I'm so-,o,o,hap
"Yeah, yeah. She was actually -- she was going to tell you but I told her that I wanted to tell you and she had to work today anyway, so I decided to-",s,s,hap
"Yeah, yeah.",ag,ag,hap
It's fantastic.  I -- congratulations. It's amazing.,o,o,hap
"Thank you.  I'm really -- I'm really excited.  And it's -- I don't know, it's like a little -- it's like a little scary, 'cause I'm like, ah, you know, it's the first time I've ever done anything like this.",o,o,hap
"But, you know, it's like I really love her and I really just -- I can't imagine spending my life with anybody else but her.  So, you know, it's like I know that's the right thing.  And if you have to, you know, if you have to question that, you know, don't- don't do it.  So we're going to do it.",o,o,hap
"And it's going to -- the -- you know, I told her that I just -- I want the color brown to be as an integral in the wedding.  And, um, maybe some greens and blues.",s,s,hap
She's okay with it.,ans,ans,hap
"Well, I mean I just told her--Well I just said, you know, hey, these are my suggestions.",s,s,hap
All fruit and the color brown. Just that. That's all- that's my only request.,s,s,hap
This is why men don't plan weddings. [LAUGHTER],o,o,hap
Yeah.  Well maybe--maybe you're right. Maybe there's something to that.,ans,ag,hap
All fruit and brown. [LAUGHTER],s,s,hap
"So, um, anyway, do you want to order now?   So, um I mean--",q,q,neu
"Oh, man, I just -- I don't know what to do.  I don't know what to do.  It's like every job, you know, I go to; every job I apply to,",s,s,dis
"I-I'm not kidding.  I've tried everything.  Like I've gone to every business and local, you know,",ans,ans,dis
"local business in- in the area and I can't- I can't get anything.  Like, nobody -",s,s,dis
What about like a temp agency?,q,q,neu
"Yeah, I tried that.  And there was like, yeah, like I did like one thing once.  But, like, that's not -- it doesn't last very long.  And it's not enough to live on.",s,ans,dis
"Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them.  You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and",s,s,neu
"I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it.",o,o,neu
"Yeah, I do.  I do.  You don't understand.",ag,ag,dis
I- You don't understand. I don't have a job.  All- My job is to look for a job.  I don't do anything else.,o,o,dis
"No, no, no, no, no.  I can't- I can't do that.  I can't, I- because if I'm not- if I'm not- if I'm not doing something that I love, then I can't -- I can't- I mean it's- what's the point?",q,dag,dis
"Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really.",q,o,neu
I'm not choosing. I'm not-,dag,dag,dis
"If you're not willing to try and work with it and find something and, you know, I mean, there are things you could do.",o,o,neu
"No, but I'm try- but like all the things that I-it's like I apply to all these places and none of them",s,s,dis
"-- I mean, I don't understand.  It's like -- I mean, I feel like I'm qualified enough.  I just don't understand.  Like, I mean, it's just like a matter of circumstance, but it's been three years, you know, three years.",s,s,dis
"Well maybe, you know, your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while.",o,o,neu
This is stupid.,o,o,dis
"I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know--",s,s,neu
"You know what, this is your fault.",o,o,dis
Excuse me?,q,q,sur
It's your fault 'cause -cause you always told me to- to do this and I did that instead.  And I didn't take your advice and - and- but you sort of were like were telling--,ans,ans,dis
It's my fault 'cause you didn't do what I told you to?,q,q,neu
"Yeah, exactly.",ag,ans,dis
Well that sounds like your fault.,o,o,neu
Yeah.,ag,ag,dis
You didn't do what I told you to do.,s,s,neu
That's 'cause you always tell me to do the wrong thing.  And I thought this time it was -- I was gonna be right by going with the opposite thing. So it's your fault because,o,s,dis
"-because you were always wrong and-and-and this time you were right. And-and I didn't -- yeah, that's why.",o,o,dis
"Well, I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it, hmm?",q,q,neu
I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions.,o,ans,neu
That's not true.  I take responsibility for my own actions.,dag,dag,neu
Really?  Whose fault is it you don't have a job?,q,q,neu
Yours.  I don't--,ans,ans,neu
[LAUGHTER],oth,oth,neu
"I had- No, I don't.  I'm sorry.  I just totally screwed this one up.  You can stop it I guess.",ans,ans,dis
Mmhmm.,b,b,neu
Right.,ag,b,neu
"lost my luggage. I didn't lose it. No, it's not like I left it somewhere and somebody took it.",s,s,dis
"And he told me to come to this desk here so I can, uh, at least get, uh, the hundred- hundred and fifty dollars that- that I'm owed for my loss.",s,s,dis
Cause that's roughly how much the bag plus all its contents was worth.,s,s,dis
"Uh. Okay.  I -- first of all, I'm very sorry you lost your bag.",ap,ap,neu
"Um, but, actually, our policy is a fifty dollar",s,s,neu
fifty dollars?,q,q,ang
refund--coverage of the bag that was lost. yes,s,ans,neu
"I don't but the thing is, I don't care about your policy.",o,o,ang
You understand?,q,q,ang
"What I want you to do is I want you to write three of those, as if I were three people.  Okay.  You can write -- you can just put my name on all --",s,s,dis
I can't do that.,dag,dag,neu
But what I'm telling you is that's what you're going to do.,s,s,dis
"No, no, because, look, I don't care what your policy says.  I mean--",o,o,ang
I'm very sorry.  I understand you're frustrated. You just got off of a flight.,ap,ap,dis
We'll cover fifty.,s,s,neu
No.  No.  No.  What I need you to do -- I need you to write checks for -- I need you to write three of them. That'll be satisfactory.,dag,dag,ang
We only cover fifty do-,s,s,dis
"Just -- you can fill out the form--We can fill out - no, no, no, we can fill out the form three times.",s,dag,ang
We only cover fifty dollars worth of lost items.,s,s,dis
And then that'll be that. It's going to be fine. Just-,s,s,dis
I'm very sorry.,ap,ap,dis
I'm very sorry.  I understand you're upset.  You just got off a long flight.,ap,ap,neu
"You don't understand. You don't understand, actually.  You don't understand because it was my luggage that was lost.  Okay.",dag,dag,dis
"Yeah.  If it was yours, but it's not. It's mine.  Okay. So just--",s,s,ang
But it's not.  It's yours.  I understand.,ap,ap,neu
I know.  We want to work with you.  We will give you the fifty dollars but I'm--,s,s,dis
"Yeah, we don't do that.  I can go ahead and send you--",dag,dag,dis
You- you- you- you're misunderstanding me.  You're going to do that.,c,c,dis
"We will definitely keep an eye out for your bag. We will try to find it.  We will, you know, fill out the form for missing items.",s,s,dis
"Look, can I just -- can I speak to your manager, please?  'Cause I- I really -- I don't, um -- I mean, I just don't want to deal with -- I know that -- I mean, I know this isn't your fault,",q,q,dis
No one can make the three check thing happen 'cause we don't do that.,ans,ans,dis
I can write you the one check.,s,s,dis
but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen.,s,s,ang
All- all that my supervisor could do is the exact same thing that I'm offering to do.,s,s,dis
"But what I'm talk -- but I'm just,just- please let me--",s,s,dis
But if I could just speak directly -- if I could just speak directly to your-- to your superior person,s,s,dis
"I'd be happy to give you a cup of coffee, too.",o,o,dis
We'll just throw that in--gratuitously.,o,o,dis
then that would be helpful to me because I just feel like if- you don't think you have the power to write three checks but you actually do. see?,o,s,dis
"No, I don't. See, I could lose my job if I did that.",o,o,dis
But your job is not my concern. My concern is getting my luggage.,o,o,dis
And your bag is not my concern.,o,o,dis
The fifty dollars I'm going to give you for your bag is really all I'm concerned with.,s,o,dis
"Look, I don't -- look, can we just not argue about this.  Like--",q,q,dis
I'm more than happy to not argue about it.  I will give you your fifty dollar certificate.,s,ans,dis
You can go ahead and go fill out the form. We'll look for your bag.,s,s,dis
So what if- what if we- what if we do three forms,q,q,dis
with different names on them? That-,q,q,dis
Then that would be lying.,ans,ans,dis
"but, no. See, 'cause",s,s,dis
if we have three forms then I can get the hundred and fifty.,s,s,dis
I'm sorry.  We can only issue one fifty dollar certificate to cover the lost bag for one person.,ap,s,dis
"Just please, will you please just work with me here? Just -- all I'm asking you to do is just work with me. I know -- I know that you get lots of people all day long who give you shit, give you crap, but",s,s,dis
"I understand you're frustrated, but--",ag,ag,neu
"um, you know, I -- this is my bag and I need the hundred and fifty dollars. Please.",s,s,dis
I know. I understand it's personal-- It's personal to you. I get that.,ag,ag,neu
Please.,c,c,ang
"But if you want to just sit down, you know, maybe have a cup of tea, calm down a little bit, we'll go ahead and we'll do what we can for you. you okey",s,s,dis
"I'm already calm. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm.",s,s,ang
"Just all I need you to do is just fill out three forms and I'll leave you alone forever, forever.  I'll never -- we'll never see each other again.",s,s,dis
"And I'm looking forward to that.  However, I can't do that. I would lose my job.",o,dag,dis
But that's not going to-- But you don't understand. You're looking forward to never seeing me again.,o,o,dis
"Oh, yes.",ag,ag,dis
But never seeing me again is not going to happen until you give me the three checks.,o,o,dis
"I'm sorry, really.  But--",ap,ap,dis
I don't -- I'm not- I'm not convinced.,o,o,dis
That I'm sorry?,q,q,dis
"Yeah.  If you were really sorry, you'd give me the three checks.",ans,ans,ang
"So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm?",q,q,ang
"Hey, how you doing?",q,q,sad
"I know- I know there's nothing I can say that will really help, but--",o,o,sad
"I know.  I just -- I don't know.  It's just weird because you have somebody who's, you know,",o,o,sad
a major part of your life and then they're gone.  And I don't know.  That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before.,s,s,sad
"But, I'm here if there's anything you need.  I mean, you just have to ask.  I know --",s,s,sad
Thanks.,g,g,sad
--it doesn't really do anything.  But--,o,o,sad
I just -- it's just not fair.,o,o,sad
I know.  It never is.,ag,ag,sad
feel the same way everybody else does.,o,o,sad
"I mean, what do you want to do?  Do you want to- do you want to talk about it?  Do you-",q,q,sad
"[BREATHING] I mean, there's nothing really to talk about.  He's gone and I'll never see him again.",ans,ans,sad
"Well I know it's not a lot of help or anything, but at least you got to know him.  I mean, at least you had the time with him that you did.",o,o,sad
Yeah.,ag,ag,sad
"I mean, we can be grateful for that.",o,o,sad
"Yeah, I don't know.  Sometimes I wish I didn't know him.  So I wouldn't--",o,o,sad
This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand.,o,o,sad
"I mean, it's just not fair.  Like, I don't know.  Why people -",q,ans,sad
"there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected.",o,o,sad
"I agree.  If I knew how to make that happen, I would certainly help you.",ag,ag,sad
I don't know what to do.,s,s,sad
"When's the service? Can- can we help?  Is there anything, I mean--",q,q,sad
"I mean, you- you can go.  I don't know.  I don't know what else.",ans,ans,sad
I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.,o,o,sad
"Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be.",o,o,sad
Yeah.,ag,ag,sad
I just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically.,o,o,sad
I know.,ag,ag,sad
"Just, you know, some thing; some genie. I need to find a genie bottle.",s,o,sad
"I don't have any magic answers.  But,",s,s,sad

I know.,ag,ag,sad

I don't see why it has to be Annie.,s,s,ang
Because it is.,s,s,dis
"Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom.",q,q,neu
Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?,q,q,neu
"Yeah, let's keep going.",ans,ans,neu
Just give it some more thought.,c,c,neu
I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that if,s,s,dis
"father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out.",s,s,sad
What the hell is this?,q,q,ang
Are you crazy?,q,q,ang
I've been a good son too long; a good sucker.  I'm through with it.,ans,ans,dis
You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?,q,q,ang
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ans,ans,ang
Must you be inspired?,q,q,ang
"Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.",ans,ans,ang
"Yes, on this I would.",ans,ans,neu
You don't want to think like that.,s,o,ang
Then you help me stay here.,c,c,neu
"Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you.",s,s,ang
I know that.  Just you help me stay here.,ag,ag,dis
"But don't think that way, you hear me?",q,q,ang
"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",ans,ans,dis
Why did he invite her here?,q,q,ang
"She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden--",q,q,ang
He's not going to marry her.,c,c,ang
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,q,q,neu
It's got that about it.,ans,ans,ang
Well so what?,q,q,neu
"Now listen, kid. Now, listen.",c,c,neu
"She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",o,o,ang
"Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.",o,o,ang
"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.",ans,ans,ang
What do you want me to do? What do you want?,q,q,dis
"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",ans,ans,ang
"But, Kate--",b,b,dis
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.",o,o,ang
Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here?,s,s,ang
She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--,s,s,ang
Calm yourself.,c,c,dis
"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone",s,s,ang
Calm yourself.,c,c,dis
"You, above all, have got to believe.  You.",c,c,ang
Why me above all?,q,q,dis
I can't help it.,o,o,sad
"What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",q,q,ang
Every day since.,ans,ans,hap
I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,o,o,hap
"Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me.",ans,ans,sad
I don't know where to start.,s,s,sad
"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",q,q,sad
How many?,q,q,sad
It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.,o,o,sad
"For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",s,s,sad
"And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,",o,o,sad
a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible.,o,o,sad
"There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",s,s,sad
because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;,s,s,sad
"to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.",o,o,sad
"You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you.",o,o,sad
"Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune.",o,o,hap
What'll I do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
"Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?",s,s,hap
"How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight.",s,s,hap
Whose is it?,q,q,neu
"It's ours.  It's mine, too.",ans,ans,ang
"Well, sure.",ag,ag,dis
You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?,q,q,ang
"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.",s,s,neu
It's after eleven; let's go home.,s,s,ang
Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?,q,q,dis
That's my point.,s,s,dis
"That's my point, too.",ag,ag,neu
So let's go home.,c,c,ang
"No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?",q,q,dis
Not particularly.,ans,ans,dis
I just don't.  It's stupid.,ans,ans,ang
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.",s,s,hap
"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die.",s,s,ang
What are you so excited about?,q,q,neu
"Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy.",ans,ans,hap
This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.,o,o,dis
"Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.",dag,dag,hap
There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested.,o,o,hap
I'm just not.,s,s,dis
"Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.",s,s,ang
"no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.",c,c,hap
Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;,s,s,hap
"just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.",s,s,hap
They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.,s,s,hap
"They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.",s,s,hap
That's the wind.,s,s,dis
Well so what did you think?,q,q,hap
About what?,q,q,dis
"Look at this, goose bumps.",c,c,neu
What I said.,ans,ans,neu
Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,dag,dag,dis
"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way, but are you having your period?",q,q,dis
"Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.",ans,ans,ang
"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",s,s,ang
"We never do, do we?  Have we ever?",q,q,ang
Twice is every time we've tried.  That's ever.,s,s,dis
You don't have any idea what I'm saying.,s,s,dis
"No, of course, not.",dag,dag,dis
"I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.",o,o,ang
It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over.,o,o,dis
"Uh,okay.  So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals;",s,s,dis
Uh.,b,b,dis
"It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.",s,s,sad
"Wait a minute, I've got it.",c,c,neu
Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.,s,s,sad
"It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.",o,o,neu
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,ans,o,sad
No.,ans,ans,sad
No.,ans,ans,sad
You want to get married again?,q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,dis
"What, you want a divorce?",q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,dis
A vacation?,q,q,dis
I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.,ans,ans,ang
"Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.",o,o,ang
"And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",o,s,ang
This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,s,s,ang
"Yes, it is.",dag,dag,dis
But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,o,o,ang
"No, I know, me neither.",ag,ag,ang
I'm doing the best I can.,ans,ans,dis
"I know you are, Augie.  Really, I do.  I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything.  But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",ag,ag,dis
I didn't say that.,dag,dag,sad
"No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.",ag,ag,sad
Yeah?,q,q,sur
"Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.",dag,dag,hap
"Okay, fine.  So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.",o,o,hap
Good God.,s,s,fea
"Nobody knows we're here, except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",s,s,fea
"It must be them, then.",s,s,fea
What are we to do?,q,q,fea
"I don't care, then.",s,s,hap
"Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.",s,s,hap
What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,q,q,hap
Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey.,ans,ans,hap
But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,ans,ans,hap
It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.,o,o,hap
"Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",q,q,neu
All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.,ans,ans,ang
"If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.",o,o,neu
"How long will it last, this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours?",q,q,hap
Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,q,q,hap
No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,ans,ans,sad
"What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left, still laugh?",q,q,hap
"Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",q,q,hap
"Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",o,o,hap
"Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you.",o,o,hap
"Oh, Charles; that was his name, Charles.  Oh, he did wriggle so beautifully.",s,s,hap
It went on intermittently for days.,ans,ans,hap
"It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom.",s,s,hap
Line?,q,q,neu
How -- that was a rouser wasn't it?,q,q,hap
That was the first time you ever hit me.,ans,ans,hap
"The manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.",s,s,hap
And very much sillier.,o,o,hap
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",s,s,neu
"The manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.",s,s,hap
"How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",o,o,hap
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",s,s,dis
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,s,s,dis
"Just a little, perhaps, nothing serious.",ans,ans,hap
Line?,q,q,neu
What of it?,b,q,ang
What about me?,q,q,ang
"If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",ans,ans,dis
"That's a nice point of view, I must say.",o,o,ang
"Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.",o,o,dis
So am I; bored stiff.,ag,ag,ang
"No, thanks.",ans,ans,ang
"I'll have a little myself, I think.",s,s,dis
I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,s,s,dis
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.,o,o,dis
It's become a habit with you.,o,o,ang
You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment.,o,o,dis
"Oh, don't be so stupid.",o,o,dis
"Really, Amanda",dag,dag,ang
What?,q,q,ang
Nothing.,ans,ans,ang
Oh.  That reply has broken my heart.,s,s,dis
"Yes, it is.",dag,dag,ang
"Oh, be quiet.",c,c,ang
Line?,q,q,neu
It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy.,o,o,neu
It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,o,o,ang
It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,o,o,dis
Line?,q,q,neu
"Snap.  Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",o,o,ang
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",dag,dag,ang
"They -- nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.",dag,dag,ang
They sting.,dag,dag,dis
They snap.,dag,dag,ang
I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.,o,o,ang
"I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?",o,o,ang
Mind your own business.,c,c,ang
You must have had a riotous time.,o,o,ang
"No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.",o,o,ang
You always had a weak head.,o,o,ang
I think I mentioned once before that I've only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening.  That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.,o,o,dis
"On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",o,o,ang
Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?,q,q,ang
"Oh, shut up.",c,c,ang
"Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.",o,o,ang
Very good idea.  I will,ag,ag,ang
You better turn that off I think.,o,o,ang
There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,s,s,ang
"There are people downstairs, I suppose",q,q,ang
"Turn it on again, please.",c,c,ang
"Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.",dag,dag,ang
Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,c,c,ang
Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.,c,c,ang
Turn it off.,c,c,ang
You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,o,o,ang

Stop.,c,c,ang
wicked little beast. And I- I hope I never see you again as long as live.,o,o,ang
You're not going like this.,c,c,ang

Shut up. Shut up.,c,c,ang

Marry you again? Huh.,s,s,ang

"What, I mean what... what's the difference?  What do I need to do there that I can't do here?",q,q,dis
"Well, I have no camera here.  I can't help you at all here, ma'am.  I have forms for something completely different.  You need to go to a different place.",ans,ans,neu
Can you just-can I just get the right-,q,q,dis
"Simply step to line two A, ma'am, I'm sorry.",ans,ap,dis
Would you be able to put me at the front of that line?,q,q,dis
There is a large line of people behind you waiting to be--,ans,ans,dis
I know.  I've been in line with these people.  I understand.  I understand what it's like.  Could you please like call over and-,q,q,dis
"I don't want to be rude here, ma'am, but line two B is where you need to be.  This is the line for registration.",ans,s,dis
"I hear that.  I hear that.  Thank you, but I've waited in line for so long, and I don't want to have to be here all day.",s,s,dis
I don't have those-,s,s,dis

"I don't have those forms, ma'am.  I can't help you.  That's why you need to go to line two A.",ans,ans,dis
And how long is that going to take?,q,q,dis
"Ma'am, obviously I have no idea how long it's taking.  There seems to be a bit of a line there.  It looks like thirty forty people.  It could take four to five hours.  I'm sorry.",ans,ans,dis
I don't-,s,s,dis
"There's nothing I can do for you, ma'am.",s,s,dis
"I don't have time for this today, and-",s,s,dis
"But, obviously I don't have time for you to stand here and waste my time in this line.  There are other people who need service behind you who are waiting for the right things.",s,s,dis
"Is there anything you can do?  Please, have some compassion.  Is there something you can do?",q,q,dis
"I am a very compassionate person, and I'm offended that you imply that I'm not.  Of course, I'm compassionate.  Look, I work in the D.M.V..  What do you think I am?  Go wait in line two A.",ans,ans,dis
Don't ask me to have somebody else come over here and move you myself.  I can't come back over there.  I'll get security if you need me to.,o,o,dis
"Please, I don't think that's necessary.  I'm just asking, maybe you could call over and say that somebody miss informed her because I didn't pick to stand in this line.  I asked them where to stand, and they told me here.",s,s,dis
"what, no, I'm sure they did not tell you here.",dag,dag,dis

Isn't there anything you can do?  Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line.,q,q,ang
"It doesn't work that way here, ma'am.",ans,ans,dis
Why not?,q,q,ang
There is a strict system here.  You need to wait in the right line for the right thing.  This is the line for registration.,ans,ans,dis
"Except they're going tell, are you going to tell me the right line to stand in this time at least?",q,q,dis
I told you it was line two A.,ans,ans,dis

"I wish I had some answers for you, babe.  I mean-I don't know what to tell you.",s,s,dis
How did you get a job?  What am I - What am I supposed to do?,q,q,dis
I went to school and I got my degree.  And I got a job.,ans,ans,neu
"I mean, I just don't--I don't know.  If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work?  It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody.",o,o,dis
Nothing's impossible.,o,dag,neu
It's not fair.,o,o,dis
You have to be willing - You have to be willing to start you know at the bottom and work your way up. and,o,o,neu
That's fine.  I'd be willing to start anywhere.  I can't get a job.,o,o,dis
I,b,b,dis
"I mean, on six seven and five an hour does not - does not pay the bills I mean.",s,s,dis
"No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something.  And it would help you get somewhere else.",o,o,neu
I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.,s,s,ang
"and No, I understand, but you've got to start somewhere.  It's better than nothing and that's all you have.  You have nothing right now.",o,o,neu
"I mean I can do the McDonald's thing for a while as humiliating as that is, but I mean then what?  I mean You can't exactly move up in that kind of industry.",o,o,dis
"Wait, You can move up.  There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that.",dag,dag,neu
"Oh come on, that's not what I envisioned for myself. Honestly, would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds?",q,q,dis
"[GARBAGE] No, I wouldn't, but I--",ans,ans,neu
This is humiliating.,o,o,dis
"Well, you know what?  Life gets humili... humiliating at times.",o,o,neu
"No, I don't I don't want to accept that.  I think that's bullshit.",dag,dag,dis
"Well, what are you going to do about it to make it different?",q,q,neu
I don't know.  I feel like I've tried everything.,ans,ans,dis
Have you?  There's got to be something else.,q,q,neu
Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.,ans,ans,dis
"I don't know what to tell you, babe. Maybe- Maybe you're right.  Maybe you do have to go someplace else.  I don't know, maybe it's just not meant to be here.  I mean I want you to-I don't want you to give up, but I mean I don't want you to move away, but at the same time, I don't like seeing you like this.",o,o,dis
I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.,s,s,sad
"Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?",q,q,sad
"If it's rent or something like that, I mean I can help you out a little bit, if- if that will help you you know stick with it.",ans,ans,neu
I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.,o,o,sad
"Well, just don't give up. And there's- you know, You never know, something might be around the corner tomorrow.",o,o,neu
"Well, you know I'm not going to let you starve.",o,o,neu
I'm just worried.,o,o,sad
It's three years.,s,s,dis
"I understand, but you know what, you've been negative for three years.",o,o,dis
"It's the way it seems to me.  You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job.  And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything, it's just that-",ans,ans,neu
That's really hard to hear.,o,o,sad
"But it's true, babe.  You've got to be more positive about things.  Like- Have some faith in yourself.",o,o,dis
I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money.,o,o,sad
"Well, exactly.  Money is not everything.",ag,o,neu
"Brian, I don't think you have a concept of what I mean by- by money.  I don't mean money like oh, I can't go get my hair and my nails done today, I mean like I can't eat.",o,o,dis
You can.,dag,dag,dis
You know I would never let that happen.  I wouldn't let that happen.,o,o,neu
I just-- I,s,s,dis
"You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again.  You know I'm not just going to you know just throw you to the wolves or something like that.  If there's any way I can help you, I will.",o,o,neu
But you have to keep trying.  You can't give up.,o,o,neu
"Yeah, I don't intend to stop trying.  I just--I don't when is when enough is enough.",o,o,dis
"And you've got to think--well, ask yourself why are they not hiring you?",q,q,neu
I don't know.,s,ans,dis
I mean are you going in for interviews?,q,q,neu
"Yeah, and I look nice and I'm you know--",ans,ans,dis
Are you presenting-,q,q,neu
charismatic.,ans,ans,dis
putting your best foot forward? or you,q,q,neu
"yah, to-totally, and I'm not--",ans,ans,dis
"Do they seem to like you? I mean, Can you get any read from them?",q,q,neu
"Yeah, I always think so, but I- I just feel like it's a lot of lip service everywhere I go.",ans,ans,dis
Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?,q,q,neu
"Yeah, I follow up.",ans,ans,dis
Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?,q,q,neu
It's just like- it's a matter of-,s,ans,dis
"not tall enough, not pretty enough, not--you know how this place is.",s,s,dis
"Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about?",q,q,neu
"I mean, anything.",ans,ans,dis
Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do?,q,q,neu
"Well, I'd like to be a working actor.",ans,ans,neu
Of course.,ag,ag,neu
But um--,b,b,neu
"Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.",o,o,neu
Yeah.,ag,ag,neu
So what's the something else?,q,q,neu
"Bartending, catering.",ans,ans,neu
"You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back.",s,s,neu
Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.,q,q,sad
If I- If you- Will you stick with it?,q,q,neu
yeah.,ag,ans,neu
"Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.",s,s,neu
Thank you.,g,g,neu
"But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?",q,q,neu
"I will, I will.",ag,ans,neu
You know I'll always help you.,o,o,neu
"Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.",s,s,neu
"Okay, what flight were you on?",q,q,neu
Um-Seventeen. Coming from --,ans,ans,neu
On what airline?,q,q,neu
It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.,ans,ans,neu
"From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?",q,q,neu
"Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so.",ans,ans,dis
So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.,q,q,neu
Right.,ag,ans,neu
Yeah.,ag,ag,neu
"Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-",s,s,neu
It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-,s,s,neu
That's good.,o,o,neu
But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh,s,s,neu
I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.,s,s,neu
"Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?",q,q,neu
"Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.",s,ans,neu
"Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?",q,q,dis
"Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?",q,q,neu
"Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.",ans,ans,dis
"Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?",q,q,neu
Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.,ans,ans,neu
And you couldn't find it?,q,q,dis
"No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.",ans,ans,dis
Are you sure?,q,q,neu
I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--,ans,ans,dis
"Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.",s,s,dis
Okay.,ag,ag,dis
"All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?",q,q,neu
"Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--",ans,ans,dis
Sentimental value.,s,s,neu
"Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.",s,s,neu
"No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.",s,s,neu
Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?,q,q,dis
"Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?",q,q,neu
Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.,s,ans,ang
"Well,",b,b,neu
Obviously ma'am.,ag,ag,dis
"I am sorry, ma'am.",ap,ap,dis
"Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.",s,s,neu
"Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?",q,q,neu
"No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?",q,q,ang
"Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.",o,o,ang
"Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?",q,q,neu
"Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.",o,ans,ang
That's what the cost of the ticket was for.,s,s,dis
"Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-",s,s,dis
"Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.",s,s,ang
"Right. Yes, ma'am.",ag,ag,dis
And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.,q,s,ang
"Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.",s,s,dis
"That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.",s,s,ang
"Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?",q,q,neu
"Well, my hands are really tied then.",s,s,neu
Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?,q,q,dis
"Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--",s,ans,neu
"Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.",s,s,dis
"Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?",q,q,neu
Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.,ans,ans,dis
"Uh, so it was really heavy.",s,s,neu
"Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.",ans,s,dis
There's nothing else you can do?,q,q,dis
"I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.",ans,ans,neu
I don't believe that for a second.,o,o,ang
Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.,o,s,neu
"Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.",s,s,dis
"Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-",s,s,neu
What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?,q,q,ang
makes up?,q,q,neu
You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-,s,s,ang
"The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.",s,ans,neu
"So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?",q,q,dis
"Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.",ans,ans,dis
And you have no guarantee.,q,q,dis
"I have no guarantee, absolutely not.",ans,ans,dis
This is ridiculous.,o,o,dis
How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?,q,q,dis
"Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.",o,ans,dis
"Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?",q,q,dis
"Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.",o,ans,dis
"Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous",o,o,dis
"No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.",dag,dag,ang
Right.,ag,ag,neu
It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.,o,o,ang
"I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.",o,o,dis
"And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.",o,s,neu
So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?,q,q,neu
"Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.",ans,ans,dis
"Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.",s,s,neu
Thanks.,g,g,dis

yeah.,ag,b,neu
[BREATHING],oth,oth,sad
I can't imagine what his- what his parents are going through.,o,o,sad

It's hard to say good-bye.,o,o,sad
Absolutely.,ag,ag,neu
[BREATHING],oth,oth,sad

Whoa.  What an idea.  Where would you want to live?,q,q,hap
That'll be awesome.,o,o,hap
"I don't know.  Well.  I wouldn't mind living by the U.S.C. campus, you know, but I'm not going to go to school right now, so.",ans,ans,hap
But I'd love to go all the US- all the U.S.C. parties and do all that crazy stuff with you.,o,o,hap
"Whoa, this is going to be so much fun.",o,o,hap

Uh! I'm so happy that you're not going to go away.,o,o,hap
"Thank you. I know, I'm really, really, really excited.",o,o,hap
"Oh, I bet you're going to love it too.  You always wanted to go to U.S.C..",o,o,hap
"I know they have a really, really great program for what I want to do.",s,s,hap
"You're going to have so much fun.  And there's lo- tons of people, you're going to meet so many people, I'm going to meet so many people too, because we're going to be there together.",o,o,hap
Can we for real live together?,q,q,hap
"Sure, why not.  I don't know why not, I'm not doing anything I have no plans, I could live anywhere I want.",ans,ans,hap
awesome.,a,o,hap
So should we get a place near campus? or-,q,q,hap
That'll be great. That'll be great.,ans,ans,hap
"We should try to find, like, a party spot though, like you know where there's going to be a lot of parties, where there are cool people, though.  Do you know any people that might be out there?",q,q,hap
okay.,ag,b,hap
"Yeah, me either.",s,s,hap
"[garbage] I know, I know, I know, we'll figure it out.  Right?  [garbage] it is going to be so much fun.",o,o,hap
It's going to be ridiculous.  It's going to be so cool.,o,o,hap
"You can't make fun of me because I'm not going to school, though, because I'm going to be working though.",s,s,hap
"[LAUGHTER] Oh, I'm going to be working too, I mean.",s,s,hap
I- I hear the same.,ag,ag,hap
Woo- I I do.,s,s,hap

You're a wild and crazy woman.,o,o,hap
"[LAUGHTER] Oh, it'll be awesome, that's for sure.",ag,o,hap
"Uh huh, it will be awesome.",ag,ag,hap
Better than if I'd picked up and moved to Boston.,o,s,hap
"living near the U.S.C. campus by myself, not going to school there. just really pathetic and sad.",o,o,hap
[LAUGHTER] by yourself.,s,s,hap
you'd be that kid,o,o,hap
"living near campus, and not going to school.",s,s,hap
"Exactly.  Mooching off of all like the college experiences, that would've been me but you have saved me from that disaster. Thank you. Thank you very much.",o,o,hap
[LAUGHTER],oth,oth,hap
"Oh, it's going to be so much fun.",o,o,hap

"Well, congratulations. and to me too, because now I get to-have-",s,s,hap

exciting.,o,o,hap
"Hi, sir.  How can I help you?",g,q,neu
"Oh, thank God.  Do you know how long I've been on the phone for half an hour trying to talk to a freaking human being.",ans,ans,dis
"All I want to do is put my, pay for my freaking credit card, and there's something wrong in my bill, Like I swear, it says I didn't paid last month, but I know I paid last month.",s,s,dis
Okay.,ag,b,neu
"I put- I've been typing my number in millions of times, it won't listen to me, it's not working, and I can't get a single human being, and finally-",s,s,dis
"[LAUGHTER] All right.  I'm sorry, sir that you've been having a hard time.",ap,ap,neu
"This is ridiculous.  I- I seriously, I don't understand why you think these automated systems are supposed to like work for anybody.  They have never, ever work for me.",o,o,ang
"I kwon, it is ridiculous",ag,ag,neu
"yeah, I understand.",ag,ag,neu
"Can you like talk to somebody about this, can you like can you tell them that this is ridiculous and can they change it from now on, is there a phone number you have that I can call that will like automatically be talking to somebody a human being.",q,q,ang
Uh- when's when's-,b,b,neu
Sir-,b,b,dis
"If yeah, well if you just slow down we'll um, we'll definitely have your problem solved and after we have your problem solved, then I can transfer you to a manager, someone who can you know, you can voice your complaint to, who will be able to something about it.",s,ans,neu
"Well, okay ,well First off, fine, fine, fine.  Let's see, first off, um- yeah my bill's wrong.",s,s,dis
"Like I know I paid last month, but it hasn't been paid and you charged me a late fee.",s,s,ang
"Okay, so where?, okay, all right, so where did you uh- locate your your bill?",q,q,neu
I got it in the mail.,ans,ans,dis
In the mail?,q,q,neu
yeah,ag,ans,dis
"So is it, is- is it at all possible that maybe this statement is just old and that the transaction hadn't been processed yet?",q,q,neu
"Well, when I look online, it says, it says that I was charged a late fee so I'm assuming that I paid on your web site-",s,ans,dis
Okay.,ag,b,neu
"like I paid right through your own company before my due date but it's still and it even shows my payment there, and then it charged me the late fee afterwards.",s,s,dis
Okay.,ag,b,neu
"Okay so, I'll just look it up and you know see what's going on, maybe we can...",s,s,neu
Okay.,ag,ag,dis
if I call it up on the screen.,s,s,neu
"Okay, great, go ahead.",ag,ag,neu
"So in the database, it looks as though um, there is a there is like a glitch in the transaction where it hadn't gone through before, but I do see that you paid the, what can you tell me the amount, what was the amount?",q,q,neu
It was one ninety eight sixty three. I paid the minimum.,ans,ans,dis
"Okay, I do see that on here, and it says that um, it had some trouble clearing for some reason.  And I think that was the problem on our end.  So um-",s,s,neu
"Well you know sometimes-- just with online transactions, things happens. so um-",s,o,neu
"No, No, No, I am grateful.",o,o,neu
"Yeah, we- Somebody went in and- and cleared the problem and it looks like you're all paid.",s,s,neu
Did they take-,q,q,neu
"You do the direct the direct it um- it's taking right out of your bank account, correct?",q,q,neu
"Yes, yes, exactly.",ans,ans,neu
Yeah so- That --that did go through.,s,s,neu
Are you taking the late fee off of my account then?,q,q,neu
"Um- I can try to do that for you, certainly.",ans,ans,neu
Because I paid it on time.,s,s,dis
"Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well.  So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer.  And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee, then you should just call back and we'll have that.",s,s,neu
Right.,ag,b,neu
"Yeah, but if I call back, I'll have to go through this whole rigmarole again. and try to get a hole or someone.",o,o,dis
Well I'll give you my direct line and my number so you can- you can  get directly to me.,s,s,neu
Really?,q,q,sur
yeah.,ag,ans,neu
"That would be wonderful, that would be great seriously.",o,o,hap
No problem.,s,s,neu
"thank you, what's the number?",q,q,hap
ahh one eight hundred three two three,ans,ans,neu
three two three,ans,s,neu
six four nine four,ans,s,neu
"six four nine four. That would be so great, thank you so much.",o,o,hap
You're welcome,s,s,neu
I'm sorry that it was an inconvenience.,ap,ap,neu
"It was horrible, but you've made it much better, thank you very much. Absolutely",o,o,hap
Have a good day.,s,s,neu
"You too, thank you so much, have a wonderful day.",s,s,hap
bye bye,g,g,neu
What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.,o,o,sad
He saw it.,s,s,sad
He was out here when it broke.,ans,ans,sad
"Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out.  We're standing right there when I cracked.",ans,ans,sad
I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.,ans,ans,sad
Did you talk to him?,q,q,sad
No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.,ans,ans,sad
He cried hard.,q,q,sad
I could hear him right through the floor of my room.,ans,ans,sad
He is thinking about him again.,o,o,sad
"It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.",o,o,sad
"I guess, he is.",ag,ag,sad
What's the meaning of that?,q,q,sad
I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.,ans,ans,sad
Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.,ans,ans,sad
"You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?",ans,ans,sad
"No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.",ans,ans,dis
"Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?",q,q,dis
We have to say it to him!,c,c,dis
"For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!",ans,ans,ang
"To you it is, and to me, but not to your father.  Now look, you can talk yourself  blue in the face, but there's no body, and there's no grave, so where are you?",q,q,dis
"Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",c,c,dis
"All right, All right mom.  Listen!",c,c,dis
"You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?",q,q,sad
You know.,ans,ans,dis
Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?,q,q,neu
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,ans,ans,neu
You know that's not just my business.,dag,dag,dis
So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?,q,q,dis
I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.,s,s,dis
"Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do.  I mean do you know what to do, because I don't.",s,s,dis
"I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time, after time.",o,o,dis
"Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.",o,o,neu
To hell with that!,dag,dag,ang
Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?,q,q,neu
"Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?",q,q,neu
"The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have",o,o,neu
"So what, I'm not fast with women.",ag,ag,dis
Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,s,s,neu
Because it is.,s,s,dis
"I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?",q,q,dis
"No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back.",ans,ans,dis
"You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.",s,s,sad
"All right, then, Mom.",a,a,dis
"I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.",s,s,dis
What the hell is this?,q,q,ang
"I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York?",ans,ans,dis
Are you crazy?,q,q,ang
Wait a minute.  Tell me this.  Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?,q,q,dis
The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?,ans,ans,ang
"Don't- you, you can't think like that!  Don't think like that!",s,s,dis
"All right!  But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!",s,s,ang
"I don't understand you, do I?",q,q,dis
Why does that bother you?,q,q,neu
She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?,q,q,neu
Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.,ans,ans,neu
"What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.",q,q,neu
How do you know he is even thinking about it?,q,q,dis
"Well, so what.",q,q,dis
"What's going on here, Joe?",q,q,dis
"Now, listen, Kate, just-",c,c,dis
She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.,s,o,ang
"She's . . . Then why is she still single.  New York is full of men, why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.",o,o,dis
How do you know why she's waited?,q,q,dis
Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.,ans,ans,dis
Look.  It's a nice day.  Why are we arguing?,q,q,dis
"Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith.  Strangers might, but not his father, and not his brother.",o,o,dis
What do you want me to do? What do you want--,q,q,dis
I want you to pretend like he's coming back!,ans,ans,ang
"But, Kate...",b,b,dis
"Because if he's not coming back, then I'll kill myself.",o,o,ang
[LAUGHTER],oth,oth,dis
"Laugh.  Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?",s,s,ang
Calm yourself.,c,c,dis
Calm yourself!,c,c,dis
"Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.",s,s,ang
"All right, all right.  Calm yourself.",c,c,dis
You've got to believe. You've got to--,c,ans,sad
What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!,s,s,ang
I can't help it!,o,o,ang
"What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",q,q,ang
You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,s,s,hap
I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?,q,q,hap
"No, it's good.",ans,ans,hap
It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.,o,o,hap
No.  But I'm not going to stay.,ans,ans,hap
Why?,q,q,sur
What?,q,q,neu
Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.,ans,ans,sad
Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.,s,s,hap
How did you know?,q,q,neu
"Well, from her point of view why else would I come?",ans,ans,neu
I guess this is why I came.,o,ans,hap
"Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you!",o,o,hap
"I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.",s,s,hap
"You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",o,o,hap
Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.,o,o,hap
I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you!,o,o,hap
"Oh Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",o,o,hap
"Not like that, you're not.",o,o,hap
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  Chris, what's the matter?",q,q,hap
"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",ans,ans,sad
It wouldn't work like this.,s,s,sad
"It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-",s,s,sad
Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.,q,q,sad
yeah sure.,ans,ans,neu
Yeah.  I lost them.,s,s,sad
how many?,q,q,sad
just about all.,ans,ans,sad
Oh gee.,b,b,sad
Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-,o,o,sad
"for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.",s,s,sad
"I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.",o,o,sad
I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.,o,o,sad
"And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-",o,o,sad
"but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?",o,o,sad
And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.,o,o,sad
And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.,s,s,sad
"It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.",s,s,sad
And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and,s,o,sad
"It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!",s,s,sad
Do you still feel like that?,q,q,neu
"I I want you now, Annie.",ans,ans,hap
"Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",o,o,sad
"Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!",o,o,hap
What would I do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
"What time is it?  Isn't it supposed to start running around midnight?  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this great night we got here.  Couldn't be better--",o,o,hap
actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing?,q,q,hap
Fine.,ans,ans,neu
"Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?  How you doing?",q,q,hap
"Oh no, you know what I did.  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.",s,s,hap
What flashlight?,q,q,neu
"The flashlight, the silver one, there's only one, isn't there?",ans,ans,dis
It's not your flashlight.,s,s,dis
Whose is it?,q,q,dis
"Well, Sure.",ag,ag,dis
"I mean you keep saying ,my flashlight, as if it's somehow just yours.  How's that suppose to make me feel?",q,q,dis
"No, Of course, you are right.  Our flashlight.  Me flashlight is you flashlight naturally.  How can we not think to bring it?",ag,ag,dis
yes.,ans,ans,neu
"Are you cold?  You want my jacket?  We should have bought a blanket.  Our blanket-.  This is great, isn't it?",s,s,hap
"I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the thing right about now. I can't believe I forgot.  And look at kid, I am surprise I make it out of the house about flies it.",s,s,hap
[LAUGHTER] I wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around,o,o,hap
you want my jacket?,q,q,hap
"It's after eleven, let's go home.",s,s,neu
There is no point in coming out here.,ans,ans,dis
Right.,ag,b,hap
So let's go.,c,c,dis
Not particularly.,ans,ans,neu
Why not?,q,q,dis
I just don't.,ans,ans,neu
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity.",s,s,hap
"Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up.",s,s,hap
"Pass up what?  Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.",s,s,dis
"Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.",s,s,hap
This is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. Yeah,o,o,hap
"What are you so excited about?  I mean it's not--it's not rocket science we are talking about, its fish.  Its fish nobody even eats.",o,o,dis
"Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that.",s,s,hap
There's There's mystery here and magic.  A little bit of the unexplainable.  I can't understand how you could not be interested.,o,o,hap
I am just not.,s,s,neu
For real?,q,q,sur
Yes.,ans,ans,neu
"Last year you also remember, our shoes got wet and I got sand in my panties and we got into a big fight.  You had a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.",s,s,dis
We weren't in a good spot.,o,o,dis
We didn't see them the first time either.,s,s,dis
"Look there, what's that?  Is it?  Is that a--Ah, it's a seaweed isn't it?",q,q,hap
"Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world.  I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second.",c,c,hap
"Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.",s,s,hap
It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.,s,s,hap
"They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up.",s,s,hap
"Well, So what do you think?",q,q,hap
"Well, so?  What do you think?",q,q,hap
What I was just saying.,ans,ans,dis
It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,dag,dag,neu
"I am not the only one, look at all these people.",dag,dag,neu
I am sorry.  It's just fish to me.,ans,ans,dis
"Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?",q,q,neu
"God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.",o,ans,ang
What's bugging you?,q,q,dis
I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like.,ans,ans,dis
"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing.  And we say, Oh, wow.  Look at the little fish.  They go home, we go home.",s,s,dis
"For heaven's sake Augie, grow up we are not going to see the grunions.",o,o,dis
Why not?,q,q,dis
We never do.  Have we ever?  We never have.,q,q,dis
"We miss them twice, it's not ever.",ans,ans,dis

Well We will see them this year.,o,o,neu
"No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up.",dag,dag,dis
I thought you wanted to see it.,o,o,dis
"I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie.",o,o,dis
"It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over.",o,o,dis
"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",s,s,dis
"Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here.",s,s,dis
"Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.",s,s,sad
"We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.",s,s,sad
"And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",s,s,hap
"Wait a minute, I got it.",c,c,neu
"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.",s,s,sad
I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.,ans,ans,sad

I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out.,ans,o,dis
What.  Welcome to the human race.,s,s,ang
"No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us.",o,o,dis
This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,s,s,sad
"Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",o,o,sad
But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.,o,o,sad
"No, I know me either.",dag,ag,sad
"I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.",o,o,sad
Maybe if you are with somebody else too?,o,o,sad
I didn't say that.,dag,dag,sad
"No, I know, but.  I know I don't make you happy.",ag,ag,sad
"For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.",o,o,sad
"Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.",o,o,sad
"Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.",dag,dag,hap
Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.,o,o,hap
I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.,o,o,hap
"Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon.",o,o,hap
"Well, look what we have got here.",s,s,hap

Good God.,s,s,hap

Behave exquisitely.,ans,ans,hap
With the most perfect poise.,q,q,hap
"Yes, I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.",ans,ans,hap
The whole business is really rather ridiculous.,o,o,neu
Meaning exactly that.,ans,ans,neu
"What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",q,q,hap
Who's they?,q,q,neu
"All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light.",ans,ans,hap
Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright [LAUGHTER].,ag,ag,hap
"Well, what if-what happens when our love-",q,q,neu
Who knows?,ans,ans,hap
"No, that fire will fade along with our passion.",ans,ans,hap
It all depends on how well we played.,ans,ans,hap
"Well, what if one of us dies, does the other laugh then?",q,q,neu
"Yes, yes, with all his might.",ans,ans,hap
"No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Come such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.",ans,ans,hap
"no, So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and --",o,o,hap
enjoy the party as long as we can like very little quite idiotic schoolchildren. [garbage] Let's savor the delight of the moment.,o,o,hap
"Darling, come here and kiss me before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",o,o,hap
Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,q,q,hap
The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.,ans,ans,hap
Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.,s,s,hap
"Horrible thing, I hate it.",o,o,hap
How long did that row last?,q,q,hap
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.,s,s,hap
"Oh, that was quite a rouser, wasn't it?",q,q,hap
"Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.",o,o,neu
And then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,s,s,hap
[LAUGHTER] I shall never forget his face.,s,s,hap
"Oh, ridiculous. utterly ridiculous",o,o,hap
"Oh, we were very much younger then.",s,s,hap
"Oh, As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",s,s,hap
You knew there was nothing.,dag,dag,neu
You knew there was nothing in that.,dag,dag,neu
Only a trivial little broach.,s,s,neu
You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,o,dag,neu
"You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?",q,q,ang
"maybe just a little, but--",ans,ans,neu
You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,s,s,ang
And what of it?,b,q,neu
What of it?,b,b,dis
"Well, I- he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didn't hurt me.",s,s,neu
"Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",o,o,ang
I'm growing quite tired and bored of this conversation.,o,o,dis
"So am I, bored stiff.  Would you like some brandy?",q,q,neu
I'll have a little I think.,s,s,neu
I don't see why you want any.  You've already had three glasses.,s,s,neu
"Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing.",o,o,neu
It's becoming a habit with you.,o,o,neu
You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.,o,o,ang
"Really, Amanda.",dag,dag,ang
Just making myself fascinating for you.,ans,ans,neu
"Oh, that reply has broken my heart.",s,s,ang
"Oh, yes it is.",dag,dag,dis
It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,o,o,ang
"Um, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.",o,o,ang
"adder don't snap, they sting.",dag,dag,ang
They sting.,dag,dag,ang
They snap.,dag,dag,ang
"I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops, okay.",o,o,ang
[BREATHING],oth,oth,dis
Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?,q,q,ang
"Yes, I did quite a bit.",ans,ans,neu
I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.,o,o,ang
Mind your own business.,c,c,ang
"You must have a riotous time, no restraint at all, very enjoyable.  I mean, you never had much anyway.",o,o,ang
"Oh dear, you really are becoming quite insufferable.  I would imagine it's because you're drunk.",o,o,ang
"Oh, You are so insufferable.  Do you stop.",o,o,dis
"Oh, This is very interesting.  We- we might get a splendid debate going about this intemperate tots.",o,o,dis
"Not very funny, dear, you better have some more brandy.",o,o,ang
Ugh.,b,b,dis
You better turn that off I think.,o,o,dis
Why?,q,q,ang
There aren't any people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.,s,s,ang
They're away in Tunis.,ans,ans,ang
Turn it on again.,c,c,ang
"Fine, if you insist on being completely insolent.",dag,dag,ang
Turn it off.  It is driving me mad.,c,c,ang
"Well, do try to control yourself darling.",o,o,ang
Turn it off.,c,c,ang
You really do need to develop uh a clearer head.,o,o,ang
Turn it off.,c,c,ang
I- I hate you.,o,o,ang
Amanda-- Listen- Listen-,c,c,ang
I hate you.,o,o,ang
"No, no.  I'm tired of listening to you.  You're boorish and idiotic and completely overbearing.",o,o,ang
Very music- amusing indeed.,dag,dag,ang
"Yeah, very amusing.  Let me go.  I'm getting out of here.  I can't believe I intended to marry you.",o,o,ang
"You are a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast, and I never want to set eyes on you again.",o,o,ang
"Oh, marry you again?  I must have been insane.  What was I thinking?  I mean, you're completely outrageous.",o,o,ang
"Shut up, shut up.  I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.",o,s,ang
Beast; brute; cad; whore,o,o,ang
Can I help you?,q,q,neu
"Oh, this- this form that you have is the wrong form.  You need to go over to the other line on the other side of the D.M.V..",s,s,neu
"Right, but this is the wrong form.  Somebody gave you the wrong form.",s,s,neu
"Yeah.  So, I can't -- I can't do anything-",ans,ans,neu
"No, but this is for um- replacements and you need a new -- whole new license as a California --",ans,ans,neu
What's the difference?  What's the difference between that form and this form?,q,q,dis
"Sir, don't get an attitude with me.",s,ans,dis
"I'm not getting a -- well, you wait in this line and not get an attitude.",s,s,ang
"No, I understand and there are a lot of people here.  But what I'm telling you is that it's different for different states and since your getting a new license in the state of California -- You have to fill out a different form than you did.",s,s,neu
"Well then, when I showed them my I.D. before and I said I had to get a new I.D, why didn't they tell me to fill out the right form?",q,q,dis
I don't know.  I don't know who told you.  It wasn't me.,ans,ans,dis
"Well, it was this girl standing right next to you.  Can we ask her why she didn't let me fill out the right form?",q,q,dis
"You- You can ask her if you want, but she's busy and she probably won't answer you.",ans,ans,dis
I know.,ag,ag,neu
"Sir, you- I mean",b,b,dis
Do you know how long it's gonna take me to start all over and fill out the new form?,q,q,dis
You can waist as much as you want,s,s,dis
Yeah.  I know it's gonna take a minute.  But you-- so you might as well get started now.,ans,ans,neu
Might as well get started now? but Just take this one.,o,c,dis
"I can't take this one, sir. this is the wrong form.",ans,dag,dis
Why can't we just -- you know what?  How about if we just pretend that I'm getting a -- renewing my California I.D. and we just don't tell anybody -- That I'm getting a new one from a different state?,q,q,dis
"Sir, please don't waste my time.",s,ans,dis
There is nothing I can do about it.  You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line.,s,s,dis
"Come on!  You know -- you can't just take -- make a little exception to the rule?  I know that you guys make exceptions.  I see -- you know, if I was-if I was your friend and you knew me, or something like that, you'd probably make a little exception for me wouldn't you?",q,q,dis
"They're different forms, we process them all different-",ans,ans,dis
"Wouldn't you? Oh, come on.  you just tell me.  You would make an exception for me.",q,q,ang
I -- there's no way I'd make an exception.,ans,ans,dis
"Sir, don't patronize me.  I can't make an exception.  I don't- I don't have the power to do that.  It's a different form.",ans,o,dis
Shh...I know you've got the power to do that.,s,dag,dis
They're processed differently.,s,s,dis
That's crap- You're crap.  I don't buy it.,o,o,dis
"Sir, you're gonna have to go stand in the other line.",s,s,dis
I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.  That's as simple as it is.  I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.,o,o,dis
I'm gonna- I'm gonna bring security over and have them escort you out.,s,s,ang
"Well, then you're just gonna look stupid because I'm just waiting for an I.D. and you're gonna make security take me out because I want my I.D.",s,o,dis
That's just dumb.,o,o,dis
But you filled out the wrong form and you're in the wrong line and you're wasting both of our times.,s,s,dis
I filled out the wrong form because they made me fill out the wrong form!,s,s,dis
"Well, that's unfortunate, sir.  You're gonna have to go stand in the other line now.",s,s,ang
"This is crap.  You know, I don't even know why I'm in this state.  Screw California.  I'm out of here.",o,o,dis

"I mean, You can tell me what.  Why is no one hiring me?  Is it me?  Be honest.  You can tell me. you know I can take it.  I can take it, you just tell me. Why?",q,q,dis
"Well, I don't really know.  I don't I don't know you in like a job situation, so.",ans,ans,neu
"Yeah, but I'm -- okay, well how about personality wise?  I mean, people who know me won't hire me.  Why?",q,q,dis
"Wow.  I don't -- I mean, do you- do you have an attitude problem when you're on the job?",q,q,neu
Maybe [garbage].,s,s,neu
"Right.  Maybe you have, like, you know a little bit of an abrasive vibe or something.",o,o,neu
An abrasive vibe?,q,q,ang
I don't know.  I'm I'm just trying --,ans,ans,neu
"Let me know that's -- that's fine.  You think I have an abrasive vibe, whatever.  You're entitled to your opinion, of course.  Maybe that's why I don't have a job.",o,o,ang
Are you getting defensive?,q,q,neu
Yeah.  That might be something you want to look at.  I mean --,o,o,neu
"I'm not like this all the time.  I mean, I don't -- I'm just frustrated right now, all right.  I just want to do --",o,o,dis
Okay.,ag,b,neu
"I want to make some money.  I need to make some money.  I've got to pay some bills, I owe people money.  I owe lots of people money.  I need to make some money.",o,o,dis
I understand.,ag,ag,neu
"Yeah, it's stressful.  I recognize that.",o,o,neu
"Do you have any idea how I can make money?  I mean, what can I do to make some quick money, something?  Anything, that's relatively within the you know law.",q,q,dis
ah.,b,b,neu
"Not- Not selling pot, right?",q,q,neu
"Right, probably not selling pot. I don't want to go to jail.",ans,ans,dis
Okay so.,b,s,neu
Fair enough.,o,o,neu
Because that would just really be a topper for me.,o,o,dis
Thank you.  Ha ha.,g,g,dis
"Sorry.  So, let's see.  What else?  What's available? What? Um.  Hmm.",q,q,neu
See what I mean?  You can't even think of anything.,s,o,dis
"Well, not off the top of head.  It will just take you know take a minute.  But do you have any, like, special skills?",q,q,neu
I can juggle.,ans,ans,dis
"Well, maybe we can find you something with juggling.",o,o,neu
I've tried.,s,s,dis
Have you checked out Craig's List and stuff?,q,q,neu
Yes!  Nobody wants a juggler.  I am not going to -- I'm not going to dress up like a clown. I'm not going to dress up like a freaking clown. No.,ans,ans,dis
"What if you do kids parties? oh, come on.",q,q,neu
"No, it's demeaning.  I am not a clown.  I have talent.  Clowns don't have talent.",dag,ans,dis
Okay.  All right.,ag,ag,neu
It's that simple.,o,o,dis
"Okay.  Well, fine. we won't- I won't argue with you about that.",s,s,neu
yeah.,ag,b,dis
What else?  I can't -- uh.  I'm drawing a blank here.,q,q,dis
You and me both.,s,ag,dis
"That's rough.  I'm really sorry, Ryan.",o,o,neu
"Well, um, is that kinda like the side of you that you let people see when you go into these job interviews?",q,q,neu
"No, I just showed that for you [garbage].",s,ans,dis
"Okay.  Well, that's good.  Yeah, I mean, you're you're- when you're happy you're a pretty personable guy.  And I don't --I don't",o,o,neu
I like to think so.,o,o,dis
I can't see where the issue would be. so,s,s,neu
see.,s,s,dis
"Yeah, well thanks for your help.",g,g,ang
I'll need it.,o,s,sad
Hi. Um-  My luggage didn't come out of the conveyor thingy.,s,s,neu
Hmm. Hmm.,b,b,neu
"So, um, what do I do?",q,q,neu
How long ago was that?,q,q,neu
"Uh- Like, an hour and a half ago.  I talked to somebody who was standing out there and they said wait.  Sometimes like random butt- pieces come out late.",ans,ans,neu
Uh-Hmm.,b,b,neu
"And so I waited there, but nothing came.",s,s,neu
"Um, okay.  Well, you can fly- file a claim.  Where were you coming from?",q,q,neu
"I was coming from um the Midwest, like Iowa.",ans,ans,neu
"So, within the country, though? umm",q,q,neu
"Yeah, I know I was in the country.  I mean, it's not that complicated.",ans,ans,neu
"Yeah, well the chances of it being lost forever, you know, are slight because -- -- you were in the --",s,s,neu
"Well, I would hope so.",o,o,neu
"Well, I mean, you know that happens pretty often that sometimes baggage -- -- gets lost.",s,s,neu
People lose --,s,s,neu
forever?,q,q,sur
yeah.,ag,ans,neu
"You know, this is actually, I mean it's -- it's a really important piece of luggage.",s,s,neu
Okay.,ag,b,neu
"I mean, it's not big or anything like that.  I mean, it's not worth a lot of money or anything.",s,s,neu
Did you have insurance on your flight?,q,q,neu
"No, you have to buy it now.  It's like thirty dollar extra.",s,s,neu
"Well, no one even told me about that.  Like, why would I think to buy insurance?  I was- It's like a three hour flight.",q,q,dis
"well, it's something that worth",s,s,neu
"yeah, I don't know.",ans,ans,neu
"How can you lose my luggage like from like, in --",q,q,dis
Chances are it's probably just you know -- taking time being um- unloaded from the airplane.,ans,ans,neu
"I should hope so.  You know, I need that today.",s,s,dis
"Um, well, there's not much I can do.  I can, you can file this report and we'll call you when it comes in.",s,s,neu
"Let me explain to you what the problem is.  My grandfather's remains are in that bag.  And I have to, like, distribute them today.  We're suppose to, you know, throw them out to the sea today.",s,s,dis
wow.,b,s,neu
"Wow.  Well, that's really important, obviously.  But, um --",ag,ag,neu
"Yeah.  I mean, if you have a suggestion, like, it would be great to help me out here.",o,s,dis
"Uh- Actually, I don't know that that's legal. Um- it is the issue",s,s,neu
"Well, I don't care if it's legal.  It's happened.  It's already done.",s,s,dis
"Yeah I mean, Your bag might have been confiscated because it's --",s,s,neu
"Well, could you tell me if it's been confiscated then.",q,q,dis
-- it's a biohazard. so- um,s,s,neu
"I mean, some information here would be great.  Some help.  Can you, like, type something in and find out?",q,q,dis
Yeah.  Let me just call security.,ans,ans,neu

"You know, he was gonna, and we -- all the way up to the end we were just talking about how- you know all the stuff we were gonna do and, you know.  When he finally kicked this stupid cancer, you know, and we were gonna --",s,o,sad
"he wanted to travel, you know.  And he's so talented.  Probably the most talented person I have ever met in my entire life.",o,o,sad
What did he do?,q,q,sad
"He was a designer, you know.  But he did everything. You know, He painted and he- and he did costume design, he did set design, he did lighting, he was --",s,ans,sad
"he just did everything.  He was literally, literally the most talented guy I have ever met in my entire life.",o,o,sad
And he's gone now and I  -- I just can't believe it.,o,o,sad
Yeah.  I'm so sorry.,ap,ap,sad
"I mean, one second you think, you know, you're just having a conversation and then --",o,o,sad
"you know, sometimes you think you want to make that phone call, or you think you want to tell somebody something, or something like that.  Do you know what I mean?  Like that's -- he was the person that I did that with.  You know, like, that's the person who I needed to call to tell things to all the time.",o,o,sad
You guys have been-,s,s,sad
"And now I don't have that person anymore, you know.  And it's -- -- it's just, you.",o,o,sad
"You think that things get easier, you know, as you as you get older and you -",o,o,sad
"and it just gets worse.  It just gets worse, everything is bad all the time; people die, your friends die, family dies, your best friends die. it's-",o,o,sad
I'm sorry. I-,ap,ap,sad
"You always think, you know when you were- you know when you were a little kid and you think something is gonna happen, like, it will all be better when I am older, you know?",o,o,sad
"Wow, Ryan I know that you are hurting right now but I don't think you always feel like that.",o,o,sad
"No, you're right.  I don't.  You're right.",ag,ag,sad
"Even, yeah -- he doesn't he would never feel that way, he would never want me to feel that way.  Of course not, but that's just where I am right now and -- -- I don't know what else to do with it.",o,o,sad
Yeah. I understand.  I think it's really healthy to grieve.,o,ag,sad
I just miss him.,o,o,sad

Oh yeah.,b,b,neu
Good tradeoff,o,o,neu
"I just want to be really close to things, you know.  I know it's not exactly the best neighborhood in the entire world. But uh-",s,o,hap
I don't- I don't think it's that bad.,o,o,neu
"I don't- you know ,I feel the same way, you know what I mean.  And everybody says a lot of other crap you know, they don't know what they are talking about anyway.",o,o,hap
yeah.,ag,b,neu
"They don't live here.  They don't know, right?",q,q,hap
"Yeah. I think it's really also if you- if you consider yourself like, us and them, kind of thing- If you think you're part of your community then --you going to like it more",ans,ans,neu

Um-,b,b,neu
You know the area better than I do.,s,s,hap
"Yeah.  I mean, I know, I know, like the- the housing surrounding the campus pretty well.",ans,ans,neu
Um- How many people do you want to live with?,q,q,neu
"Not a lot.  I mean, I wouldn't want to live with more than three other people.  So, like four of us total, right?",ans,ans,hap
All dudes?,q,q,neu
I don't care. I don't care.,o,ans,hap
Um- I think I have some friends.,s,s,neu
yeah?,q,q,hap
yeah.,ag,ans,neu
That would be perfect.,o,o,hap
"There's actually, a friend of mine is um- moving out of her place and her place is amazing-- And it's really cheap.",s,s,hap
Really?,q,q,hap
Really?,q,q,hap
yeah.,ag,ans,neu
Cheap is exactly what I need- Because I have no money at all.,s,s,hap
Okay.,ag,ag,neu

"You've got a lot- oh, awesome.",o,o,hap
Oh cool.,b,o,hap
"So it comes Indian like. And you know I'm kind of smart, so.",o,o,hap
Yeah.,ag,ag,hap
totally.,ag,ag,neu
good for you.,o,o,hap
"And yeah, well, I mean, basically I just applied for any and every possible scholarship and grant that could come by, so I can go.",s,s,hap
the way to do it.,o,o,neu
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's gonna work out.  I'm gonna be able to pay for it, I'm gonna go, I mean, I'll have a little debt in the end.  But I don't care.",s,s,hap
"Wow, are you so excited?",q,q,hap
It's just you know a dream come true.  How could you not be excited about a dream come true?,o,o,hap
"You're gonna be so busy, too. You're going to have to work so hard.",o,o,hap
"Oh I know, I know.",ag,ag,hap
"But I'm so looking forward to being so busy. You know what I mean?  It's the kind of busy you've got to love, right?",o,o,hap
Because you're doing something you love.  That's the kind of busy you want.  I want to be able to do that for the rest of my life.  Be that kind of busy.,o,o,hap
All right.  Wow.  So exciting.,o,o,hap
I had to tell you right away.  I knew you'd be excited.,o,o,hap
We'll have fun.,o,o,hap
Yeah.  We'll have so much fun.,ag,ag,hap
Great.  Okay.,a,o,hap
"D.S.L. Extreme, can I help you?",q,q,neu
"Hi, I need- I need some help.  I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again.",ans,ans,dis
This happens every two weeks?,q,q,neu
Yeah.  That my service just goes out.,ans,ans,dis
You've lost your connection.,s,q,neu
yeah.,ag,ans,dis
okay.,ag,ag,neu
"And I'll reset the IP address.  I will do like, you know, direct connect the modem to my computer, and then reset everything, and then put the router back in. And-",s,s,dis
Hmm.  Mmm.,b,b,neu
"Is not, It it It will work again for like a week and then it goes out again.",s,s,dis
Has somebody tried to pin your site?,q,q,neu
"Uh, yeah.  We've pinned it a couple of times.",ans,ans,neu
"Okay. Um-  Well, I don't know.  And it consistently happens every two weeks?",q,q,neu
"Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something.",ans,ans,neu
"Well, you know what, does your D.S.L. cable -- you have D.S.L., right?",q,q,neu
Hmm. Mmm.,b,ans,neu
"Okay.  Does your D.S.L. cable, you know, travel a long distance by any chance? - Does it go through any windows?  I mean, is it --",q,q,neu
yeah.,ag,b,neu
"It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance.",s,ans,neu
"Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished.",q,q,neu
"Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection.  And it won't always be a bad connection, but it will be bad off and on.",ans,ans,neu
"Well, I- I can check that.  Is there anything else we can do, too?  Like, I'll go through and check the line throughout the house, but --",q,q,neu
"Yeah, well, absolutely.  What we can -- let's just go ahead and just do a basic diagnostic of your system first off, okay.  Can you go down to your start button?",ans,ans,neu
Uh huh.,b,b,neu
"Okay, And uh- go ahead and click on run.",s,s,neu
All right.,ag,b,neu
Okay.  We're gonna get your -- a little black box is going to come up.  Do you see that?,q,q,neu
"Yeah, I see that.",s,ans,neu
"Okay Uh- You've got your C calling, go ahead and type in directory list.",s,s,neu
Okay.,ag,ag,neu
And hit enter.,s,s,neu
Okay.,ag,ag,neu
Okay?  Can you tell me what that says?,q,q,neu
"Uh, it it's like a bunch of different letter and numbers and stuff.",ans,ans,neu
"Okay Okay, And Um- letters and numbers and stuff.  Uh- Can you - Can you just type in IP address search? And hit enter.",q,q,neu
"Uh huh, Okay.",b,ag,neu
Okay?  Does it list your IP address there?,q,q,neu
"Uh, yeah looks -- no, no.  It's set to zeros.",ans,ans,neu
"It's set to zeros.  Okay, maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again.",o,o,neu
"Well, if it does happen again, let me give you my direct number and you can call me.  Actually, I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's --",ans,ans,neu
Wow.  That would be amazing.  Really?,q,q,sur
"Of course.  we seriously- Yeah, I mean, obviously you've worked- you know -- I don't want to hassle you anymore.",ans,ans,neu
"Oh, my God.  I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is.  I literally call and talk to five different people.  Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people.  And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now.",o,o,hap
I completely understand.,ag,ag,neu
It's so frustrating.,o,o,dis
Absolutely. And I just don't want that to happen to you anymore.,ag,ag,neu
Absolutely.  It's a new service we are offering.,s,s,neu
"Yeah, accountability.  It's awesome.",o,o,hap
Uh huh Uh huh We want you to be happy.  You're our customer.  You're the most important thing. Okay?,q,q,neu
"Wow.  You know I was thinking about changing internet providers, but but that- that really is enough to change my mind.",o,ans,hap
"Great.  Well, that makes me very happy.  That makes us all happy here at D.S.L. Extreme.  Is there anything else I can help you with?",q,q,hap
No.  I'm just gonna go have a fantastic day now.,ans,ans,hap
All right.  You have a wonderful day.  Call us anytime.,s,s,neu
Okay.  Thanks.,g,g,hap
"All right.  Bye, bye.",g,g,hap
What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.,o,o,sad
When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it?,q,q,sad
Did you talk to him?,q,q,sad
No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.,ans,ans,sad
He cried hard?,q,q,sad
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?,ans,ans,dis
"What do you want to do, argue with him?",q,q,dis
I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.,ans,ans,dis
"Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?",q,q,ang
We have to say it to him.,c,c,dis
how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?,q,q,dis
For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!,ans,ans,ang
"To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?",q,q,dis
"The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.",s,s,ang
"All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you?",q,q,dis
You know.,ans,ans,neu
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,ans,ans,neu
It's not just my business.,dag,dag,dis
"Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.",o,o,ang
So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?,q,q,dis
"Oh, so it isn't just my business?",dag,dag,ang
I'm just saying.,s,s,dis
You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.,o,o,ang
"Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",o,o,ang
"I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.",s,s,ang
She is not Larry's girl!,dag,dag,ang
"From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?",s,s,ang
"I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want, I have to pull back because I might hurt somebody else.  My whole bloody life; time after time after time.",o,o,dis
"Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that",o,o,neu
To hell with that!,dag,dag,ang
Have you asked Annie yet?,q,q,neu
"Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?",q,q,neu
"Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.",o,o,neu
So what?  I'm not fast with women.,ag,ag,ang
"Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.",s,s,dis
Because it is.,s,s,dis
"Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years.",s,s,dis
"I know her best, all right?  I don't know.  I grew up next to her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",q,q,dis
"No.  I don't want a -- look, your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because, I don't.",ans,ans,dis
"I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.",s,s,ang
"But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.",s,s,ang
What the hell is this?,q,q,sur
"I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York.",ans,ans,ang
Are you crazy?,q,q,ang
I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.,ans,ans,ang
"Yes.  On this, I would.",ans,ans,ang
"Well, you help me stay here.",c,c,ang
"All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.",s,s,ang
"I know that, mom.  Just, you help me stay here.",ag,ag,dis
Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?,q,q,ang
"I don't understand you, do I?",q,q,dis
"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",ans,ans,dis
"Yeah, I can see that.",s,s,dis
What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.,o,o,sad
"What do you mean?  I was the first one up, he was still in bed.",q,q,sur
He was out here when it broke.,ans,ans,sad
About four this morning.  I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.,ans,ans,sad
"I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.",ans,ans,sad
No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.,ans,ans,sad
"Yes, yes he is.  I don't know the meaning in it.  But I know one thing, mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.",ans,ans,sad
I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time that he knows that nobody else believes that Larry's alive. I mean,ans,ans,dis
"Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for a long time?",q,q,dis
"For Gods sake, three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane!",ans,ans,dis
"The trouble is the God damn newspapers, I mean, ea- each week a new boy turns up out of nowhere.  So the next one is gonna be Larry.  So you--",s,s,dis
"All right.  All right, just listen.",c,c,dis
You know it's not just my business.,dag,dag,dis
"What do you want me to do?  I mean, You're old enough to know your own mind.",o,o,dis
So it's all right then?  I should just go ahead with it?,q,q,dis
"Isn't it your business, too, if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.",o,o,ang
"I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.",s,s,dis
She's not Larry's girl.,dag,dag,ang
"I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back because it might hurt somebody else, my whole bloody life, time after time, after time.",o,o,dis
what to hell with that!,dag,dag,ang
Have you asked Annie yet?,q,q,neu
"Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels like your father does.",q,q,neu
"I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",c,c,dis
The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,o,o,neu
"So what, I'm not fast with women?",ag,ag,dis
Because it is.,s,s,dis
"Well, that's a good reason.  But it don't mean a thing. I mean, You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.",s,s,neu
"[garbage] I don't know.  It's just,",s,s,dis
"she's who I know best. I know her since I- I was a kid I grew up with her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",s,s,dis
"No I don't want a-  Your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  If you marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.",s,s,dis
"Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.",s,s,sad
"All right then, mom.",a,a,dis
"I've given it three years of thought.  I had hoped if I waited, dad would've forgotten him by now and we could have a- a regular wedding and everybody happy.",o,c,ang
But if that can't happen then I'll just get out.,s,s,ang
What the hell is this?,q,q,sur
"I'll get out.  I'll go get married someplace else, I- I'll live someplace else, maybe New York.",ans,ans,ang
Are you crazy?,q,q,ang
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ans,ans,ang
Must you be inspired?,q,q,ang
"Yeah, I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids.",ans,ans,ang
You don't want to think like that.,s,s,ang
"All right.  But don't think like that because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  All of this, all of it, it's all just for you.",s,s,dis
"I know that, mom.  Just you help me stay here.",ag,ag,dis
"Well, I am thinking like that.",dag,ans,ang
"I don't understand you, do I?",q,q,dis
"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",ans,ans,ang
Why does that bother you?,q,q,neu
"Well, maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again.",ans,ans,neu
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,o,s,neu
"What are you talking about?  He grew up next to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?  Don't look at me like that.  He hasn't told me anything he didn't told you.",q,q,dis
Why do you think he's even thinking that?,q,q,neu
He's got that about it.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, so what?",q,q,dis
"What's going on here, Joe?",q,q,ang
Now listen.,c,c,dis
How do you know why she's waited?,q,q,dis
"Look, it's a beautiful day outside, why are we arguing?",q,q,dis
"Well, what do you want me to do about it?  What do you want?",q,q,dis
"I want you to pretend like he's coming back.  Both of you, don't think I haven't noticed you and Chris since she's gotten here.  I don't want any nonsense.",ans,ans,dis
But Kate?,b,b,dis
"No, because if she- he's not coming back then I'll kill myself. Laugh!  Laugh at me!",o,o,dis
Calm yourself.,c,c,dis
Calm yourself.,c,c,dis
Only last week a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.,s,s,dis
All right.  All right.,a,a,dis
You above all have got to believe.,c,c,ang
"What's that suppose to mean, me above all?  Look at you, you're shaking.",s,s,ang
I can't help it.,o,o,ang
"What have I got to hide, Kate?  What the hell is the matter with you?",q,q,ang
You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,s,s,neu
It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.,ans,ans,hap
"So, you're not sorry I came?",q,q,hap
Why?,q,q,sur
"Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave.",ans,ans,neu
Well-,b,b,neu
"I figured they would, your mother at least.",ag,ag,neu
"Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?",ans,ans,neu
"You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything.",o,o,hap
"Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time.",s,s,hap
I almost got married two years ago.,ans,ans,sad
Why didn't you?,q,q,sur
You felt something that far back?,q,q,hap
Everyday since.,ans,ans,hap
"Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you sure can be ambiguous.",ans,ans,hap
"oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that?",o,o,hap
"Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",o,o,hap
Not like that you're not.,o,o,hap
I kissed you.,s,s,sur
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter?",q,q,sad
Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you.,s,s,sad
"No, nothing like that.",ans,ans,sad
Even in your letters there was something ashamed.,s,s,sad
"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going for me.",ans,ag,sad
You have to tell me.,c,c,sad
I don't I don't know where to start.,s,s,neu
It wouldn't work like this.,s,s,sad
It's so mixed up with so many other things.,s,s,sad
"Yeah, sure.",ans,ans,neu
I lost them.,s,s,sad
How many?,q,q,sad
Just about all.,ans,ans,sad
"It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men.",o,o,sad
I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.,o,o,sad
"I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.",o,o,sad
It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there.,s,s,sad
"I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.",s,s,sad
"It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean,",s,s,dis
"you can take those things out of the war, but if you're gonna drive that car you've got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man. And you've got to be a little bit better because of that.  Because if you're not, then it's all just loot and there's blood on it and I didn't want any of it.",o,o,dis
And I guess that included you.,o,o,sad
Do you still feel like that?,q,q,sad
"I want you now, Annie.",ans,ans,sad
"Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.",o,o,sad
"Oh, Annie,",a,ag,hap
[LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
Annie I am going to make you a fortune.,o,o,hap
"What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh, this is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though, so how are you doing?",q,q,hap
Fine.,ans,ans,sad
"What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think?",q,q,hap
"This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight.",s,s,hap
What flashlight?,q,q,neu
"The flashlight.  The silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?  Stupid.",ans,ans,hap
"Oh, no, of course, our flashlight.  Me flashlight is to you flashlight, naturally.",ag,ag,hap
"How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember?",q,q,hap
"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.  Oh, this is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Oh, a six pack would be just the ticket right about now.",s,s,hap
"I can't believe I forgot.I'm like a little kid.  I'm surprised I made it out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh, [LAUGHTER]",o,s,hap
"Oh, I wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand. or something",o,o,hap
Do you want my jacket?,q,q,hap
Oh,b,b,dis
"Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.",s,s,hap
"I mean, Think about people in Kansas, they've got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up.",s,s,hap
Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.,s,s,dis
"Yeah, but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know,",s,s,hap
"and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that.",s,s,hap
"I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy.",o,o,hap
"What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science, this is just fish.  Fish nobody even eats.",o,o,dis
"Yeah, they do.",dag,dag,dis
Augie.,b,b,dis
"All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested.",o,o,hap
I'm just not.,s,s,sad
For real?,q,q,dis
"I don't get it.  I mean, the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life. And last year I remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn't even notice until you got in the car.",s,s,dis
"Well, if you also remember last year we- our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, we had a big argument, you had a sore throat, and we didn't see the grunion.",s,s,dis
We didn't see them the first time either.,s,s,dis
"Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed.",s,s,hap
"Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second;",c,c,hap
somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-,s,s,hap
"And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name,",o,o,hap
"they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up.",s,s,hap
"Well, so what do you think?",q,q,hap
"Well, so, what do you think?",q,q,hap
About what?,q,q,neu
What I was just saying.,ans,ans,hap
It's ridiculous.,o,o,neu
It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,dag,dag,dis
"I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me.",ans,ans,dis
"uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?",q,q,neu
"God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.",ans,ans,ang
What's bugging you then?,q,q,dis
I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.,ans,ans,dis
"It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home.",s,s,dis
We We don't ever.  Have we ever?,q,q,dis
We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever.,ans,ans,dis
"Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever",s,s,ang
"No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.",dag,dag,ang
"Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over.",o,o,dis
You don't understand anything I am saying.,s,s,dis
"No, of course not.",dag,ag,dis
I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.,o,o,sad
"I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so --",s,s,dis
"you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem.  All right.  So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.  And so, all right, and I'm putting on my coat, I'm putting out the animals, I'm pulling the car out of the garage.",s,s,dis
Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.,s,s,sad
"And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",s,s,sad
"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",s,s,sad
"It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?",q,q,neu
I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.,ans,ans,sad
No.,ans,ans,sad
No.,ans,ans,sad
No.,ans,ans,sad
"What, you want me to blow in your ear?",q,q,dis
"Do you want to get married again?- What?  What, do you want a divorce?",q,q,dis
A vacation?,q,q,dis
No.,ans,ans,sad
"A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want?",q,q,dis
I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.,o,ans,sad
"Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?",q,q,ang
"Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!",q,q,ang
"Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",s,s,ang
Right.,ag,ag,dis
But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.,o,o,sad
"Now, I know.  Me either",ag,ag,sad
"This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?",o,o,sad
I'm trying the best I can.,o,o,sad
"I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.",ag,ag,sad
But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.,o,o,sad
"Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?",o,o,sad
I didn't say that.,dag,dag,sad
"No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.",ag,ag,sad
"For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.",o,o,sad
Really?,q,q,sur
"Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.",ans,ans,sad
"Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.",dag,dag,hap
"I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.",o,o,hap
"Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.",o,o,hap
"Oh, well look what we've got here.",s,s,hap
"Well, it isn't champagne.",s,s,hap
"No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.",ans,ans,hap
Or not.,ag,o,hap
Or not.,ag,ag,hap
Do you think it's them?,q,q,fea
I wonder.,ans,ans,hap
"what, Nobody knows we are here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",s,s,hap
Must be them then?,s,s,fea
What do we do?,q,q,hap
"We're all right, aren't we, darling, whatever happens?",s,s,neu
"Now and always, my sweet.",ag,ag,hap
I don't care then.,s,s,hap
It was bound to happen sooner or later.,s,s,hap
"Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.",s,s,hap
"Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.",q,q,hap
With the worst- with the most perfect poise?,q,q,hap
"Uhh, It's amazing how once you feel--",o,o,hap
"things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?",q,q,hap
"Uhh, You mustn't say that, my darling.",o,o,hap
"Being that sacred and wonderful thing, love.",q,q,hap
"Um What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my endless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",q,q,hap
Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,c,c,neu
"You mustn't be serious, darling.  That's just what they want.",o,o,hap
Who's they?,q,q,neu
"All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them, Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.",ans,ans,hap
uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.,o,o,hap
"If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.",o,o,neu
Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun all right.,ag,ag,hap
"Well, will we always bicker and fight?",q,q,neu
No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,ans,ans,hap
"What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then?",q,q,neu
"Yes, yes, with all his might.",ans,ans,hap
"No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.",ans,ans,hap
"So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children.",o,o,hap
"[garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets.",o,o,hap
"Elliott, worms don't pop.",s,s,neu
"I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best.",o,o,hap
Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,q,q,hap
The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.,ans,ans,hap
Horrible thing.  I hated it.,o,o,hap
I know you did.  You threw it out the window into the Canal below.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,ag,ag,hap
How long did that roue last?,q,q,hap
"Oh, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown?",s,s,hap
"Oh, It burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom.",s,s,hap
"[LAUGHTER] That was quit a rouser, wasn't it?",q,q,hap
"Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.",o,o,hap
I should never forget his face. [LAUGHTER],s,s,hap
We were very much younger then.,s,s,hap
You knew there was nothing in that.,dag,dag,neu
Only a trivial little broach.,s,s,neu
Not at all.  I quite like it.  I wear it often.,dag,dag,neu
"[garbage], No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.",dag,dag,dis
You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he?,q,q,dis
"Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious.",ans,ans,neu
He let him kiss you.  You said you did.,s,s,dis
"Well, what of it.",q,q,neu
Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,s,s,neu
"Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",o,o,ang
I'm getting very bored with this conversation.,o,o,dis
"Me, too, bored stiff.",ag,ag,ang
Do you want some brandy?,q,q,neu
No thanks.,ans,ans,neu
I think I'll have a little.,s,s,neu
It's becoming a habit with you.,o,o,neu
Don't be stupid.,c,o,dis
"Amanda, really.",dag,dag,ang
"Nothing.  Are you going out somewhere, darling?",q,q,dis
Just making myself fascinating for you.,ans,ans,neu
"Um- Well, that reply has just broken my heart.",s,s,dis
"No, it isn't.",dag,dag,ang
"No, it it is not, be quiet.",c,c,ang
It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,o,o,ang
"Nonsense, they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap!",dag,dag,dis
They sting.,dag,dag,dis
They snap.,dag,dag,ang
"So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?",q,q,neu
"Yes, I did quite a lot.",ans,ans,neu
"You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?",o,o,ang
"I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway.",o,o,ang
You're quite insufferable.  I do imagine it's because you're drunk.,o,o,dis
I am not the slightest bit drunk.,dag,dag,ang
You always had a weak head.,o,o,neu
I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.,o,o,ang

All I really needed was a plan.,s,s,neu
See I wanna have three kids,s,s,neu
"Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.",q,o,hap

Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost,o,s,hap
"I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.",dag,s,neu
"Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!",ag,ag,hap
"Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.",ans,ag,neu
"Yes, I realize that",ag,ag,neu

"Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withÂ¬Ãgirls.",o,s,hap
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.,q,q,sur

Oh my God! This is it! I really hope it's you!,o,oth,hap
I hope it's you.,o,oth,neu
Me too!,ag,oth,hap
"First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me",o,s,hap
"Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!",q,q,hap
"Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.",o,s,neu
"Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine",o,s,neu
Yes!!! Oh!!,b,ag,hap
Hypothetically!,s,oth,ang
Still.,b,oth,neu
If Phoebe were my maid of honor,s,s,neu
"Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.",ans,s,neu
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.,ag,ag,neu

Fine!,ag,ag,ang
"Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!",o,oth,hap
"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?",q,s,neu
It's not just the drum noise.,s,s,neu
"Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye!",s,s,ang
"Oh god, my eye!""",s,oth,ang
"I mean, it is so annoying.",o,s,ang
"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.",ans,ag,neu
"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?",q,q,sur
Maybe on some level.,ans,ans,neu
Joey? Could you get that? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?,q,q,sur

You could do that!,o,o,hap

"Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?",q,q,neu
Oh yeah!,b,ans,hap
"Well okay, so then you're fine.",s,s,neu
The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.,o,s,neu
Okay?,q,b,neu
So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.,o,s,neu
"It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.",o,s,neu
Really?,q,b,sur

You can't!,dag,dag,sur
Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.,q,o,sur
In the hall.,ans,oth,neu
"Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.",o,o,neu
But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.,s,o,neu
"Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.",s,s,neu
"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.",s,s,neu
That's a good one!,a,ap,hap
"Hey, Joe.",g,g,neu

"Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!",q,q,sur
You'll see.,s,ans,neu
"I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.",s,o,hap
"Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles",c,s,neu
"And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , andÂ¬Ã You go.",s,o,neu

Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.,o,o,neu
What am I going to do?,q,q,fea
"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.",s,ans,neu

I don't know you guys.,s,s,fea
"All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.",s,s,dis

"Oh, come on!",s,oth,sad
"Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.",o,o,neu
"Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.",o,o,neu

I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!,o,ag,sad
"What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.",s,s,sad
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!,s,o,sur
"Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...",o,s,hap
What's that supposed to mean?,q,q,sur
Nothing! It's an expression.,ans,ans,neu
No it's not.,dag,dag,neu

Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!,s,s,ang
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!,s,q,sur
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?,q,q,sur
"Well, I'm upsetÂ¬Ã³for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.",o,ans,dis
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.,q,s,sad
"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.",o,o,ang
"But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.",o,s,neu
You got all that from the back of her head?,q,s,sur
