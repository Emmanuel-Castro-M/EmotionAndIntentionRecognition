She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know? (sad)  47. - Joey - . Mmhmm.Mmhmm.Mmhmm. (xxx) |

You're not going to...We should totally throw a party. (excited)  12. - Fey - . I know. We should throw a party. (excited)  13. - Fey - . At Arapaho we could afford that. [GARBAGE]. Yeah.

|1.  - Fey - What's he going to say? (frustrated) 2. - Fey - . Maybe we should tell him before he sees it. (xxx)  3. - Joey - . He saw it. (neutral)  4. - Fey - . How could he see it?  I was the first one up; he was still in bed. (surprise)  5. - Joey - . He was out here when it broke. (neutral)  6. - Fey - . When? (xxx)  7. - Joey - . Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked. (neutral)  8. - Fey - . What was he doing out here at four o clock in the morning? (xxx)  9. - Joey - . I don't know. (neutral)  10. - Fey - . He's dreaming of him again, walking around. (neutral)  11. - Joey - . I guess he is. (neutral)  12. - Fey - . It's getting to be just like after he died.  What's the meaning of that? (xxx)  13. - Joey - . I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing, Mom, you've made a terrible mistake with father. (frustrated)  14. - Fey - . What? (xxx)  15. - Joey - . Being dishonest with him, you know.  This kind of thing always pays off and it's paying off. (xxx)  16. - Fey - . What do you mean dishonest? (xxx)  17. - Joey - . You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him? (neutral)  18. - Fey - . What do you want to do?  Argue with him? (frustrated)  19. - Joey - . I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive. (frustrated)  20. - Joey - . You know?  Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him, dreaming of him?   Do we contradict him?  Do we say, we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years now? (frustrated)  21. - Fey - . You can't say that to him. (frustrated)  22. - Joey - . We've got to say it to him. (neutral)  23. - Fey - . Where's the proof?  Do you have any proof? (frustrated)  24. - Joey - . For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane. (frustrated)  25. - Fey - . To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face.  But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you? (frustrated)  26. - Joey - . Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you. (neutral)  27. - Fey - . It's that the trouble is those God damn newspapers.  Every month some new boy comes back and so the next one is going to be Larry, they just-- (xxx)  28. - Joey - . All right, all right, all right.  You know why I asked Annie here, right? (frustrated)  29. - Fey - . Why? (frustrated)  30. - Joey - . You know. (neutral)  31. - Fey - . Well I got an idea, but what's your story? (neutral)  32. - Joey - . I'm going to ask her to marry me. (neutral)  33. - Fey - . Well that's only your business, Chris. (xxx)  34. - Joey - . You know it's not just my business. (neutral)  35. - Fey - . Well what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind. (xxx)  36. - Joey - . So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it? (neutral)  37. - Fey - . Well you want to make sure that your father is not going to -- (xxx)  38. - Joey - . Then it's not just my business. (frustrated)  39. - Fey - . I'm just saying. (xxx)  40. - Joey - . You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things. (anger)  41. - Fey - . Oh.  I ignore what I got to ignore.  That girl is Larry's girl. (xxx)  42. - Joey - . She's not Larry's girl. (frustrated)  43. - Fey - . From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl. (frustrated)  44. - Fey - . Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go. (frustrated)  45. - Joey - . I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time. (frustrated)  46. - Fey - . You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that. (frustrated)  47. - Joey - . To hell with that. (frustrated)  48. - Fey - . I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet? (frustrated)  49. - Joey - . I wanted to get this settled first. (neutral)  50. - Fey - . Well how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does. (frustrated)  51. - Joey - . Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him. (neutral)  52. - Joey - . And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me. (neutral)  53. - Fey - . The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did. (frustrated)  54. - Joey - . So what.  I'm not fast with women. (frustrated)  55. - Fey - . Why does it have to be Annie? (frustrated)  56. - Joey - . Because it is. (frustrated)  57. - Fey - . Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all. (frustrated)  58. - Joey - . I don't know. (frustrated)  59. - Fey - . You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years. (frustrated)  60. - Joey - . I can't help it, I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her, you know?  These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie. (frustrated)  61. - Joey - . Mom, what do you want?  A diagram? (frustrated)  62. - Fey - . I don't want a diagram. (frustrated)  63. - Fey - . He thinks he's coming back Chris. (frustrated)  64. - Fey - . You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead... (frustrated)  65. - Fey - . ...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't. (frustrated)  66. - Joey - . All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING] (frustrated)  67. - Fey - . Just give it some more thought. (neutral)  68. - Joey - . I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy. (frustrated)  69. - Joey - . But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else. (frustrated)  70. - Fey - . What the hell is this? (anger)  71. - Joey - . I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York. (neutral)  72. - Fey - . Are you crazy? (xxx)  73. - Joey - . I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker. (frustrated)  74. - Fey - . You have a business here.  What the hell is this? (anger)  75. - Joey - . The business?  The business doesn't inspire me. (frustrated)  76. - Fey - . Oh.  Must you be inspired? (anger)  77. - Joey - . Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy. (frustrated)  78. - Joey - . I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.  Now it's just where to find it. (frustrated)  79. - Fey - . You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this? (frustrated)  80. - Joey - . On this, I would. (neutral)  81. - Fey - . Well you don't want to think like that. (frustrated)  82. - Joey - . Then help me stay here. (neutral)  83. - Fey - . All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you. (anger)  84. - Joey - . I know that.  Then just help me stay here. (frustrated)  85. - Fey - . Just don't think like that. (anger)  86. - Joey - . Well I am thinking like that. (frustrated)  87. - Fey - . I don't understand you, do I? (frustrated)  88. - Joey - . No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy. (frustrated)  89. - Fey - . I can see that. (frustrated) |
|1.  - Fey - Why did he invite her here? (xxx) 2. - Joey - . Why does that bother you? (xxx)  3. - Fey - . She's been in New York three and an half years, why all of a sudden? (xxx)  4. - Joey - . Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her. (neutral)  5. - Fey - . Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see. (xxx)  6. - Joey - . What do you mean?  You know he lived next door to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her? (xxx)  7. - Joey - . [BREATHING] You don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything more than he told you. (frustrated)  8. - Fey - . He's not going to marry her. (anger)  9. - Joey - . How do you know he's even thinking about it? (neutral)  10. - Fey - . It's got that about it. (anger)  11. - Joey - . Oh.  So what. (xxx)  12. - Fey - . What is going on here, Joe? (anger)  13. - Joey - . Now listen. (frustrated)  14. - Fey - . She is not his girl.  She knows she's not. (anger)  15. - Joey - . You can't read her mind. (frustrated)  16. - Fey - . Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited. (anger)  17. - Joey - . How do you know why she waited? (neutral)  18. - Fey - . Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right. (anger)  19. - Joey - . Hey look, it's a nice day, huh?  Why are we arguing? (frustrated)  20. - Fey - . Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother. (anger)  21. - Joey - . What do you want me to do? What do you want? (frustrated)  22. - Fey - . I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here. (anger)  23. - Fey - . I won't stand for any nonsense. (anger)  24. - Joey - . Kate. (frustrated)  25. - Fey - . Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look. (anger)  26. - Joey - . [BREATHING] (frustrated)  27. - Joey - . Calm yourself. (frustrated)  28. - Fey - . Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe. (anger)  29. - Joey - . Okay. Calm yourself. (frustrated)  30. - Joey - . I know. All right, all right. All right. Okay.  Calm yourself. What does that mean, me above all? (frustrated)  31. - Joey - . Look at you, you're shaking. (xxx)  32. - Fey - . I can't help it. (frustrated)  33. - Joey - . What have I got to hide?

You know? (sad)  61. - Joey - . Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had. (sad)  62. - Joey - . They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today. (sad)  63. - Joey - . And I had this idea as I was watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, you know, but this one thing was being made.  It was kind of a monument, it's kind of responsibility, man for man. (xxx)  64. - Fey - . Mmhmm. (neutral)  65. - Joey - . To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them. (sad)  66. - Joey - . But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work. (sad)  67. - Joey - . Driving my new car and seeing a new refrigerator. (xxx)  68. - Joey - . I mean...You can't take those things out of a war. when you drive that car and you see that new refrigerator, you have to know that it came out of the love that a man can have for another man. (xxx)  69. - Joey - . And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you. (sad)  70. - Fey - . Do you still feel that way? (xxx)  71. - Joey - . I just want you to know Annie.

There is no point. (xxx)  34. - Joey - . Right. (neutral)  35. - Fey - . That's my point. (xxx)  36. - Joey - . Wait, that's my point, too. (neutral)  37. - Fey - . Well, then let's go. (frustrated)  38. - Joey - . No, no.  Okay.  That's not my point.  My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it? (frustrated)  39. - Fey - . Not particularly. (neutral)  40. - Joey - . Why not? (neutral)  41. - Fey - . I just don't.  It's stupid. (xxx)  42. - Joey - . Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up. (neutral)  43. - Fey - . Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die. (frustrated)  44. - Joey - . Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever. (neutral)  45. - Joey - . This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy. (neutral)  46. - Fey - . I don't see why you're so excited; this isn't a freaking moon landing we are talking about.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats. (xxx)  47. - Joey - . Yeah they do. (frustrated)  48. - Fey - . Oh Augie (frustrated)  49. - Joey - . okay... well, Whatever.  But it's a fish who do something no other fish do.  It's like those swallows returning to Capistrano or like those lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs. (xxx)  50. - Joey - . There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested. (neutral)  51. - Fey - . I'm just not. (xxx)  52. - Joey - . For real? (surprise)  53. - Fey - . Yeah. (frustrated)  54. - Joey - . God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life? (neutral)  55. - Joey - . And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car. (neutral)  56. - Fey - . Last time, you'll also remember, we got our shoes wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat and we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions. (xxx)  57. - Joey - . Ahh...we weren't in a good spot. (neutral)  58. - Fey - . Hmm.  We didn't see them the year before either. (frustrated)  59. - Joey - . We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things. (neutral)  60. - Joey - . Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed. (excited)  61. - Joey - . God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this. (happy)  62. - Joey - . Right now out there, there is this mass of silver fish and it's heading this way.  No one sent them an invitation, no one told them, no one even gave them a map. (xxx)  63. - Joey - . Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming. (excited)  64. - Joey - . They are swimming right now.  They are swimming as if that is the only thing that matters to them. (xxx)  65. - Joey - . It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge. (excited)  66. - Joey - . And they are swimming right now to this very point where we stand for this huge celebration of sex and death. (xxx)  67. - Joey - . Oh look.  I'm giving myself goose bumps, my hairs are standing up on my arm. (xxx)  68. - Fey - . That's the wind. (neutral)  69. - Joey - . So what do you think? (happy)  70. - Fey - . About what? (neutral)  71. - Joey - . About all of that, about all I was talking about. (happy) |
|1.  - Joey - Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm. (excited) 2. - Fey - . That's the wind. (neutral)  3. - Joey - . Well, so, what do you think? (excited)  4. - Fey - . About what? (neutral)  5. - Joey - . About what I was saying. (neutral)  6. - Fey - . I think it's ridiculous. (xxx)  7. - Joey - . It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact. (xxx)  8. - Fey - . It's PR! Somebody sold you a bunch of crap that there is this wonderful thing that is going to happen tonight on the beach. (xxx)  9. - Joey - . Not just me, look at all of these people. (frustrated)  10. - Fey - . Everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us coming back for more, it keeps us excited.  We keep thinking that life is going start at any minute if we can just find the right spot, get in on the action. (xxx)  11. - Joey - . Are we talking about the same thing, here? (xxx)  12. - Fey - . I'm sorry, it's just fish to me. (xxx)  13. - Joey - . Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period? (neutral)  14. - Fey - . Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting. (anger)  15. - Joey - . Well then, what's bugging you? (frustrated)  16. - Fey - . We just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like. (frustrated)  17. - Joey - . There is nothing to it; we come down here, the fish arrive, they flop around, they do their fish thing.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish and we go home. (frustrated)  18. - Fey - . For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive. (anger)  19. - Joey - . Why not? (frustrated)  20. - Fey - . Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever? (anger)  21. - Joey - . We've missed them twice. (frustrated)  22. - Fey - . Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever. (anger)  23. - Joey - . They'll show up this time. (frustrated)  24. - Fey - . No they won't.  It's like waiting for Santa Claus. (xxx)  25. - Fey - . I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish never show up. (frustrated)  26. - Joey - . I thought you wanted to see it. (xxx)  27. - Fey - . You don't understand anything I am saying. (frustrated)  28. - Joey - . No. Of course not. (frustrated)  29. - Fey - . I did want to see it, I still do, I always do.  I just... (xxx)  30. - Fey - . I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is. (sad)  31. - Joey - . It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatized over. (frustrated)  32. - Fey - . For God's sake, this is not about fish. (anger)  33. - Joey - . Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here. (frustrated)  34. - Joey - . Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go. (neutral)  35. - Joey - . Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage. (neutral)  36. - Fey - . Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married. (neutral)  37. - Fey - . We thought I was pregnant, we got a bottle of champagne, we had no glasses.  We took off our shoes and you asked me to dance. (xxx)  38. - Fey - . You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be. (happy)  39. - Joey - . Wait a minute, I got it. (xxx)  40. - Fey - . Drinking champagne from the bottle, (xxx)  41. - Joey - . It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that. (neutral)  42. - Fey - . dancing barefoot in the sand. (frustrated)  43. - Joey - . That's what it is?  Right?  You want this to be like the other time, right? (frustrated)  44. - Fey - . I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things. (sad)  45. - Joey - . Sure.  All right.  Okay. (neutral)  46. - Joey - . Listen, do you want to dance? (neutral)  47. - Fey - . No. (neutral)  48. - Joey - . Do you want me to go get some champagne? (neutral)  49. - Fey - . No. (xxx)  50. - Joey - . Do you want to take off your shoes? (happy)  51. - Fey - . No, no. Nothing. (frustrated)  52. - Joey - . Then what? (xxx)  53. - Joey - . Do you want to get married again? (happy)  54. - Fey - . No. (neutral)  55. - Joey - . What?  What?  Do you want a divorce? (oth)  56. - Joey - . A vacation? (xxx)  57. - Fey - . No. (frustrated)  58. - Joey - . Like a new carpet?  A poodle?  A back rub?  Ice cream?  A suicide pact?  What do you want?  What the hell do you want? (xxx)  59. - Fey - . I just want something to turn out like I expected it to. (xxx)  60. - Joey - . Well welcome to the human race, huh?  Do you think I had some grand fantasy going that four years down the line we would come to this beach and be arguing over fish?  No. (xxx)  61. - Fey - . [BREATHING] (frustrated)  62. - Joey - . No I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all roses and peaches and the bills would just pay themselves.  And we'll have three, fat rosy cheeked children.  Huh, baby, the joke's on us.  Because you know what you get? (frustrated)  63. - Joey - . Do you know what you get?  You get this. (frustrated)  64. - Fey - . This? What is this?  This is nothing.  This isn't even anything. (frustrated)  65. - Joey - . Yes it is. (neutral)  66. - Fey - . Sure.  This is standing on the beach waiting.  This is fighting. (xxx)  67. - Joey - . Right (xxx)  68. - Fey - . I mean this is a lot of things, but it's just... (frustrated)  69. - Joey - . [BREATHING] (frustrated)  70. - Fey - . Do you understand what I am saying? (frustrated)  71. - Joey - . I'm doing the best I can. (frustrated)  72. - Fey - . I know you are Augie, I know. (sad)  73. - Fey - . I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else. (sad)  74. - Joey - . Maybe if you were with someone else, too. (sad)  75. - Fey - . I didn't say that. (sad)  76. - Joey - . I just- I know I don't make you happy. (sad)  77. - Fey - . Don't be ridiculous.  Anything that- anything I am doing, I'd rather be doing it with you. (surprise)  78. - Joey - . Yeah? (surprise)  79. - Fey - . Yeah.  Don't you know that? (surprise)  80. - Fey - . For Heaven's sake Augie. (xxx)  81. - Fey - . You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself. (sad)  82. - Joey - . You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't. (neutral)  83. - Fey - . So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person. (neutral)  84. - Joey - . I don't know, it seemed like such a good spot to me. (frustrated)  85. - Joey - . We have a great view of the moon from here, though, huh? (neutral)  86. - Fey - . Hmm.  I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon. (happy)  87. - Joey - . [BREATHING] (neutral)  88. - Joey - . And look what I got here. (happy)  89. - Fey - . Augie, you bought refreshments. (happy)  90. - Joey - . It's not champagne. (xxx)  91. - Fey - . I guess we don't need glasses. (happy)  92. - Joey - . [BREATHING] (happy)  93. - Joey - . Do you want to go home?  Are you cold? (neutral)  94. - Fey - . I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all. (happy)  95. - Fey - . Augie, I'm sorry. (sad)  96. - Joey - . Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come. (neutral)  97. - Fey - . Or not. (neutral)  98. - Joey - . Or not. (happy) |
|1.  - Joey - Good God. (fear) 2. - Fey - . Is it them? (fear)  3. - Joey - . I wonder. (fear)  4. - Fey - . Freda is the only one who knows we are here.  She wouldn't ring up. (fear)  5. - Joey - . It must be them then. (fear)  6. - Fey - . It had to happen sooner or later.  What are we going to do? (fear)  7. - Joey - . [BREATHING] (fear)  8. - Joey - . We are okay, aren't we darling? (xxx)  9. - Fey - . Now and always, sweet. (xxx)  10. - Joey - . I don't care then. (excited)  11. - Fey - . It had to happen sooner or later. (xxx)  12. - Joey - . Hello?  Hello?  I'm sorry, what's that? (xxx)  13. - Joey - . No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER] (happy)  14. - Fey - . [LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine. (happy)  15. - Joey - . What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER] (happy)  16. - Fey - . We'll behave exquisitely. (excited)  17. - Joey - . With perfect poise. (happy)  18. - Fey - . I think I shall do a curtsy. (excited)  19. - Joey - . It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they? (happy)  20. - Fey - . Hmm.  The pity is that one can't stay happy. (xxx)  21. - Joey - . Darling, don't say that. (xxx)  22. - Fey - . It's true.  I think the whole thing's a cruel joke. (xxx)  23. - Joey - . What?  This beautiful and sacred thing - love? (xxx)  24. - Fey - . Yes.  Meaning just that. (happy)  25. - Joey - . Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean? (happy)  26. - Fey - . Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious. (happy)  27. - Joey - . Oh darling, you mustn't be serious.  It's just what they want. (xxx)  28. - Fey - . Who's they? (excited)  29. - Joey - . All of those futile moralists who make life unbearable.  You have to laugh at them, be flippant. (xxx)  30. - Joey - . You know, flippancy brings out the acid in their darned, light and sweetness. (xxx)  31. - Fey - . you know if I laugh at everything then I must laugh at us, too. (xxx)  32. - Joey - . Oh of course.  We are figures of fun.  All right. (xxx)  33. - Fey - . How long with it last, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours? (xxx)  34. - Joey - . Who knows? (happy)  35. - Fey - . Shall we always want to bicker and fight? (xxx)  36. - Joey - . Oh no.  That fire will fade along with our passion. (xxx)  37. - Fey - . Oh dear, should we like that? (xxx)  38. - Joey - . Well it depends on how well we've played. (xxx)  39. - Fey - . What happens if one of us dies?  Does the other one still laugh? (xxx)  40. - Joey - . Yes.  Yes with all of his might. (excited)  41. - Fey - . Well that's serious enough, isn't it? (xxx)  42. - Joey - . No, no, no, no. no.  Death is a very laughable thing.  It's a cunning little mystery, it's all done with mirrors. (xxx)  43. - Fey - . I think you are talking nonsense. (xxx)  44. - Joey - . Oh.  So is everyone, in the long run. (xxx)  45. - Joey - . Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children. (excited)  46. - Fey - . [LAUGHTER] (happy)  47. - Joey - . Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets. (happy)  48. - Fey - . Oh Elliott, worms don't pop. (happy)  49. - Joey - . Oh See, I don't care what you do, see.  You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world.  I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best. (happy)  50. - Fey - . Aw.  Thank you, darling.  The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you. (happy)  51. - Joey - . Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice? (xxx)  52. - Fey - . Which particular one? (xxx)  53. - Joey - . The one where you put that tiny painted wooden snake in my bed. (xxx)  54. - Fey - . Oh Charles, that was his name.  He did wiggle so beautifully. (excited)  55. - Joey - . [GARBAGE] (xxx)  56. - Joey - . It was a terrible thing.  I hated it. (disgust)  57. - Fey - . I know you did.  You threw him out the window into the Grand Canal.  I'll never forgive you for that. (xxx)  58. - Joey - . How long did that row last? (xxx)  59. - Fey - . It went on intermittently for days. (xxx)  60. - Joey - . Uh huh. (xxx)  61. - Joey - . But the worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown. (xxx)  62. - Fey - . Oh And it burnt my comb, too, and all of those towels in the bathroom. (xxx)  63. - Joey - . That was a rouser, wasn't it? (happy)  64. - Fey - . [LAUGHTER] That was the first time you hit me. (xxx)  65. - Joey - . I did not hit you very hard. (xxx)  66. - Fey - . The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]  How utterly, utterly ridiculous. (happy)  67. - Joey - . [LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER] (happy)  68. - Joey - . [LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then. (happy)  69. - Fey - . [LAUGHTER] And very much sillier. (happy)  70. - Joey - . However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. (xxx)  71. - Fey - . Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that. (xxx) |

Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that. (happy)  5. - Joey - . I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him. (neutral)  6. - Fey - . Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch. (happy)  7. - Joey - . It was bristling with diamonds.  In the worst possible taste, too. (xxx)  8. - Fey - . It was not.  I still have it, and I wear it often.  It is very pretty. (xxx)  9. - Joey - . You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. (neutral)  10. - Fey - . I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination. (neutral)  11. - Joey - . Well, you let him kiss you, huh?  You said you did. (frustrated)  12. - Fey - . Well, what of it? (neutral)  13. - Joey - . What of it? (xxx)  14. - Fey - . It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me. (xxx)  15. - Joey - . What about me? (anger)  16. - Fey - . If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it. (xxx)  17. - Joey - . That's a nice point of view, I must say. (xxx)  18. - Fey - . Oh dear.  I'm bored with this conversation. (frustrated)  19. - Joey - . So am I.  I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE]  Do you want some brandy? (frustrated)  20. - Fey - . No.  Thank you. (xxx)  21. - Joey - . I'll have a little, I think. (neutral)  22. - Fey - . I don't know why you'd want any, you've already had three glasses. (xxx)  23. - Joey - . No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones. (neutral)  24. - Fey - . I just think it's silly to go on and on and on about such a thing. (xxx)  25. - Joey - . You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on. (frustrated)  26. - Fey - . It's become a habit with you. (xxx)  27. - Joey - . Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment. (frustrated)  28. - Fey - . Don't be stupid. (anger)  29. - Joey - . Really, Amanda. (anger)  30. - Fey - . What? (anger)  31. - Joey - . Nothing. (frustrated)  32. - Joey - . you going out somewhere, dear? (neutral)  33. - Fey - . No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you. (anger)  34. - Joey - . That reply has broken my heart. (xxx)  35. - Fey - . Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man. (anger)  36. - Joey - . Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true. (neutral)  37. - Fey - . No it isn't. (anger)  38. - Joey - . Yes it is. (neutral)  39. - Fey - . You shut up. (anger)  40. - Joey - . Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable. (anger)  41. - Fey - . It's funny it hasn't worked such wonders for you. (xxx)  42. - Joey - . Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder. (anger)  43. - Fey - . Adders don't snap, they sting. (xxx)  44. - Joey - . Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap. (anger)  45. - Fey - . They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops. (anger)  46. - Joey - . Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce? (anger)  47. - Fey - . Yes I did, quite a lot. (anger)  48. - Joey - . And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow. (anger)  49. - Fey - . Mind your own business. (anger)  50. - Fey - . You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk. (anger)  51. - Joey - . I think I am not in the least bit drunk. (anger)  52. - Fey - . You've always had a weak head. (anger)  53. - Joey - . I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that. (anger)  54. - Fey - . On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy. (anger)  55. - Joey - . That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four?  Or a child of six?  Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots. (anger)  56. - Fey - . Oh shut up. (anger)  57. - Fey - . Shut up. (anger)  58. - Fey - . Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy. (anger)  59. - Joey - . [LAUGHTER] That's a very good idea.  I think I will. (xxx)  60. - Joey - . Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs. (anger)  61. - Fey - . Why? (neutral)  62. - Fey - . There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio. (neutral)  63. - Joey - . Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs. (anger)  64. - Fey - . They are away in Tunis. (neutral)  65. - Joey - . This is no time of year for Tunis. (neutral)  66. - Fey - . Turn it on again, please. (xxx)  67. - Joey - . I will do no such thing. (anger)  68. - Fey - . Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic. (anger)  69. - Joey - . Will you turn that off, it's driving me mad. (anger)  70. - Fey - . You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself. (anger)  71. - Joey - . Turn it off. (anger)  72. - Fey - . I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully. (anger)  73. - Joey - . Amanda, listen, listen. (anger)  74. - Joey - . Oh.

I mean they weren't just men, you know. (sad)  56. - Joey - . For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. (sad)  57. - Joey - . He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had. (sad)  58. - Joey - . They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today... (sad)  59. - Joey - . And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument... (sad)  60. - Joey - . You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know. (sad)  61. - Joey - .

I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again... (sad)  63. - Joey - . And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them. (sad)  64. - Joey - . Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator. (sad)  65. - Joey - . Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man... (sad)  66. - Joey - . And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it. (sad)  67. - Joey - . I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too. (sad)  68. - Fey - .

(xxx)  43. - Joey - . Why not? (frustrated)  44. - Fey - . I just don't, it's stupid. (xxx)  45. - Joey - . It's not stupid.  It's a natural phenomenon. (frustrated)  46. - Joey - . People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up. (anger)  47. - Fey - . Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die. (anger)  48. - Joey - . Yeah but that like flopping around is what to do it's like spawning or mating or something.  This is like the highlight of their little fish lives.  It's like life's last orgy. (xxx)  49. - Fey - . I don't know what you're so excited about.  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about, it's fish, it's a fish nobody even eats. (frustrated)  50. - Joey - . Yeah, they do. (neutral)  51. - Fey - . Oh, Augie. (frustrated)  52. - Joey - . Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know. (excited)  53. - Joey - . It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this. (excited)  54. - Fey - . I'm not.

And last year I remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn't realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car. (frustrated)  60. - Fey - . Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions. (anger)  61. - Joey - . We just weren't in a good spot though. (neutral)  62. - Fey - . We didn't see them the year before either. (anger)  63. - Joey - . We just weren't in a good spot I'm telling you this is a much better spot. (xxx)  64. - Joey - . Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay?  So just--just think about it all right?  Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it... (neutral)  65. - Joey - . Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way... (excited)  66. - Joey - . They don't know why, we don't know why.  No one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction... (excited)  67. - Joey - . They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming... (excited)  68. - Joey - . Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one... (excited)  69. - Joey - . And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here... (excited)  70. - Joey - . It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind. (excited)  71. - Joey - . It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm. (excited)  72. - Fey - . That's the wind.

Are we talking about the same thing? (xxx)  18. - Fey - . I'm sorry it still just fish to me. (frustrated)  19. - Joey - . Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period? (neutral)  20. - Fey - . Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting. (anger)  21. - Joey - . Okay, well then what's bugging you? (xxx)  22. - Fey - . I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like. (anger)  23. - Joey - . Is not supposed to like anything.

No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus. (anger)  32. - Fey - . I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show. (anger)  33. - Joey - . Okay, I'm trying to work this backwards (frustrated)  34. - Fey - . You don't understand anything I'm saying. (frustrated)  35. - Joey - . and figure out where we took a turn to the worst thing. (frustrated)  36. - Joey - . Of course not. (frustrated)  37. - Fey - . I did want to see it I still do, I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it just never is.

(neutral)  43. - Fey - . We thought I was pregnant we had this bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance so we took off our shoes. (xxx)  44. - Fey - . While we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me, right into my ears so I could feel them much as hear them. (xxx)  45. - Fey - .

I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to. (anger)  66. - Joey - . Well, welcome to the human race. (frustrated)  67. - Joey - . You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No. (anger)  68. - Joey - . You think there would be times when you'd look at me like I was used Kleenex and then I'd look at you and think "Holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska." (xxx)  69. - Joey - . No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and-- (sad)  70. - Joey - . No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this. (sad)  71. - Fey - . This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything. (anger)  72. - Joey - . Yeah, it is. (neutral)  73. - Fey - . Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting. (anger)  74. - Joey - . Right. (neutral)  75. - Fey - . This isn't anything like I thought anything would be. (sad)  76. - Joey - .

It was bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste. (xxx)  11. - Fey - . Not at all. It was very pretty. I still wear it often. (xxx)  12. - Joey - . You sent out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. (xxx)  13. - Fey - . I did not you worked whole thing up in your jealous imagination. (xxx)  14. - Joey - . Well, you let him kiss you.  You said you did. (xxx)  15. - Fey - . Well, what of it? (neutral)  16. - Joey - . What of it? (xxx)  17. - Fey - . It gave him a lot, a great deal of pleasure and it didn't hurt me. (xxx)  18. - Joey - . And what about me? (xxx)  19. - Fey - . If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you'd never known a thing about it. (xxx)  20. - Joey - . That's a nice point of view I must say. (xxx)  21. - Fey - . I'm bored with this conversation. (xxx)  22. - Joey - . So am I.  I'm bored stiff.  You want some brandy? (xxx)  23. - Fey - . No, thank you. (neutral)  24. - Joey - . I'll have a little, I think. (neutral)  25. - Fey - . I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses. (anger)  26. - Joey - . Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses. (neutral)  27. - Fey - . I just think it's silly you know to go on and on and on about such a thing. (xxx)  28. - Joey - . You can hardly call three glasses of liquor in a whole evening going on and on and on. (xxx)  29. - Fey - . I just, I just think it's becoming a habit with you. (xxx)  30. - Joey - . Hmm.  Well, you needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment, okay? (xxx)  31. - Fey - . Do be quiet. (xxx)  32. - Joey - . Really, Amanda. (frustrated)  33. - Fey - . Don't be stupid, what? (anger)  34. - Joey - . Nothing. (frustrated)  35. - Joey - . Are you going out somewhere dear? (neutral)  36. - Fey - . No, darling I'm just making myself fascinating for you. (xxx)  37. - Joey - . That reply has broken my heart. (xxx)  38. - Fey - . Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you? (anger)  39. - Joey - . As matter the fact that's perfectly true. (xxx)  40. - Fey - . Oh no, it isn't. (xxx)  41. - Joey - . Yes, it is. (xxx)  42. - Fey - . Don't be stupid, shut up. (xxx)  43. - Joey - . You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable. (anger)  44. - Fey - . Oh, well that's funny.  It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you. (xxx)  45. - Joey - . You know what?  You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder. (anger)  46. - Fey - . Adders don't snap, they sting. (xxx)  47. - Joey - . Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap. (anger)  48. - Fey - . They sting. (anger)  49. - Fey - . I don't care.  I don't care, do you understand?  I don't mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops. (anger)  50. - Joey - . Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce? (anger)  51. - Fey - . Yes, I did quite a lot. (anger)  52. - Joey - . I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too. (anger)  53. - Fey - . Oh, mind you own business. (anger)  54. - Joey - . I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh?  No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how. (anger)  55. - Fey - . You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk. (anger)  56. - Joey - . I am not in the least bit drunk. (anger)  57. - Fey - . You always had a weak head. (anger)  58. - Joey - . I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that. (anger)  59. - Fey - . On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy. (anger)  60. - Joey - . Oh very, very interesting Amanda.  How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know?  Intemperate tots. (anger)  61. - Fey - . Shut up. (anger)  62. - Fey - . Not very funny darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy? (anger)  63. - Joey - . That's a very good idea I think I will. (anger)  64. - Joey - . Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs. (anger)  65. - Fey - . Why? (anger)  66. - Fey - . There are no people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio. (xxx)  67. - Joey - . Well then you'll wake the people downstairs. (anger)  68. - Fey - . They are away in Tunis. (anger)  69. - Joey - . This is no time a year for Tunis. (anger)  70. - Fey - . Turn it on again, please. (anger)  71. - Joey - . I will do no such thing. (anger)  72. - Fey - . Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic. (anger)  73. - Joey - . Turn it off. It's driving me mad. (anger)  74. - Fey - . I won't. (anger)  75. - Joey - . Turn it off. (anger)  76. - Fey - . Stop it. No. Go away. (anger)  77. - Joey - . Amanda listen. Listen. (anger)  78. - Fey - . listen Oh I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully. (anger)  79. - Joey - . That's very amusing indeed. (anger)  80. - Fey - . Oh you're cruel you're...you're...I hate you, I hate you. Go away. You're conceited. You're overbearing. You're utterly impossible. (anger)  81. - Joey - . You...You're an evil minded, self-centered little wench and I never want to see you again. (anger)  82. - Fey - . This is the end do you hear me?  Finally and forever. (anger)  83. - Joey - . You're not going like this. (anger)  84. - Fey - . Oh yes I am...Oh yes I am. Let go of me. You let go. You...urgh...You're a cruel friend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again...Ha...Never, never, never, never. I hope you die in torment. You beast. (anger)  85. - Joey - . No you're not. (anger)  86. - Joey - . Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live. (anger) |

No. no  Uh, no one told you that you needed your original birth certificate. (xxx)  7. - Fey - . No it doesn't say it on the form. (frustrated)  8. - Fey - . I mean it just says that you need some form of identification, but it doesn't say what kind of identification. (frustrated)  9. - Fey - . I mean if I had known--I would have brought it.

I mean, I don't carry my original documents with me because if those things get destroyed, then what do you, you know what I mean, like if I loose my wallet or something, I'll never have them again. (frustrated)  17. - Fey - . I have my passport and I have my driver's license. And that's all I have. (frustrated)  18. - Joey - . Alright, I don't know what to tell you right. (frustrated)  19. - Joey - . I think you're just gonna--you're gonna have to get 'em and then you can back and then, we'll help you out.  Maybe, we can- (frustrated)  20. - Fey - . But, isn't there anything you can do.  Can't you make an exception this one time?  My picture is on both of those identifications.  It's not like you don't know that it's me. (frustrated)  21. - Joey - . I can't. (frustrated)  22. - Fey - . And I can give you my social-- (frustrated)  23. - Joey - .

And I can tell you where I was born and what time and by who and what day. (frustrated)  27. - Joey - . Okay.  But how do I--that's- that's not proof to me.  How do I know that, you know, that it's really you.  I need-- (frustrated)  28. - Fey - . I can't go--I have to go back to work.  I don't have time to go back to my house and get all of that stuff and then get back in line and wait for another forty five minutes. (frustrated)  29. - Joey - . Well, the weekends are not as busy.  Maybe you can uh, come and try to get here early-- (frustrated)  30. - Fey - . Um, I have kids.  I have to take them places on the weekends.  I don't have time to come back here.  Please.  I really need you to help me. (frustrated)  31. - Joey - . I can't.  There's nothing I can do.  I'm sorry. (frustrated)  32. - Fey - . Well.  [BREATHING] I just--I just don't.  I-I'm sorry that I'm standing here-- But I can't leave. I- (frustrated)  33. - Joey - . The line-- (xxx)  34. - Fey - . I really need this done today.

Ok, but you're right now you're holding up more people in line by standing here-- and letting (anger)  36. - Fey - . Well, why didn't the D.M.V. put that you needed your birth certificate on the application then? (anger)  37. - Joey - . I--when you're going to the D.M.V., you usually need pretty professional identification-- (frustrated)  38. - Joey - . You know, Official documentation-- (anger)  39. - Fey - . Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate?  Nobody does that. (anger)  40. - Joey - . No, but you come--you come to the D.M.V., it's something-- You should've- You should've figured-- (frustrated)  41. - Fey - . With your driver's license and your passport.  Just like everybody else. (anger)  42. - Joey - . But, without your drive--where-where- what about your identification without your driver's license?  I mean, you need--you needed something before then? (frustrated)  43. - Fey - . Who--you always use your driver's license.  I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway. (anger)  44. - Joey - . All right.  Well, um, you know, I'd love to help you, but--nothing I can do. (frustrated)  45. - Joey - . So, if you wanna go get your birth certificate, um, maybe come back--I don't--maybe you can talk to the person in the--in the front of line maybe.  I don't know. (frustrated)  46. - Fey - . Do you have a supervisor? (frustrated)  47. - Joey - . I am the supervisor.  So-- (frustrated)  48. - Fey - . Well, thank you very much.  You've been very helpful. (frustrated) |

Trouble is the God damn newspapers.  Every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere so, you know, the next one is gonna be Larry. (xxx)  29. - Joey - . All right.  All right.  Listen to me.  You know why I brought Annie here don't you? (frustrated)  30. - Fey - . Why? (xxx)  31. - Joey - . You know. (xxx)  32. - Fey - . I've got an idea, but what's the story? (sad)  33. - Joey - . I'm gonna ask her to marry me. (neutral)  34. - Fey - . Well, that's only your business, Chris. (neutral)  35. - Joey - . You know it's not only my business. (frustrated)  36. - Fey - . What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind. (anger)  37. - Joey - . So it's all right then? (frustrated)  38. - Joey - . I'll go ahead with it? (frustrated)  39. - Fey - . Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't going to-- (xxx)  40. - Joey - . Well, then it isn't just my business-- (anger)  41. - Fey - . I'm just saying that-- (neutral)  42. - Joey - . Ah, sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  I mean, isn't it your business too if I tell Dad and flips--freaks out about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things. (xxx)  43. - Fey - . I ignore what I gotta ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl. (xxx)  44. - Joey - . She's not Larry's girl. (anger)  45. - Fey - . From your father's point of view, he isn't dead.  And you've no right to take his girl. (frustrated)  46. - Fey - . And you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.  Now what can I do for you? (frustrated)  47. - Joey - . I don't know why, but, every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer.  My whole bloody life.  Time after time after time. (frustrated)  48. - Fey - . You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that. (neutral)  49. - Joey - . To hell with that. (anger)  50. - Fey - . [BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet? (neutral)  51. - Joey - . I wanted to get this settled first. (xxx)  52. - Fey - . Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does. (neutral)  53. - Joey - . Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me. (sad)  54. - Fey - . Trouble is, you don't see enough women. (sad)  55. - Fey - . You never did. (frustrated)  56. - Joey - . So what, I'm not fast with women. (xxx)  57. - Fey - . I just don't see why it has to be Annie. (frustrated)  58. - Joey - . Because it is. (neutral)  59. - Fey - . Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.  I mean, you've been away for--at war.  It's been five years. (frustrated)  60. - Joey - . I can't help it.  I know her best.  I mean, I grew up next door to her. (xxx)  61. - Joey - . These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram? (frustrated)  62. - Fey - . I don't want a diagram.  Umm-- He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead. (frustrated)  63. - Fey - . I mean, what's gonna happen to your father?  Do you know?  I don't. (frustrated)  64. - Joey - . All right.  All right, then, Mom. (frustrated)  65. - Fey - . I just--give it some more thought. (frustrated)  66. - Joey - . I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy. (frustrated)  67. - Joey - . But if I can't--if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out. (xxx)  68. - Fey - . What the hell is this? (surprise)  69. - Joey - . I'll get out.  I'll get married and go live some place else.  Maybe New York. (xxx)  70. - Fey - . Are you crazy? (anger)  71. - Joey - . I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it. (anger)  72. - Fey - . What about the business?  What the hell is this? (anger)  73. - Joey - . The business?  The business doesn't inspire me. (anger)  74. - Fey - . Must you be inspired? (anger)  75. - Joey - . Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful. (anger)  76. - Joey - . I want a family.  I want kids.  I want something that I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now, where do I find it? (xxx)  77. - Fey - . Tell me, you'd leave the business? (xxx)  78. - Joey - . Yes, on this I would. (neutral)  79. - Fey - . Well, you don't want to think like that. (anger)  80. - Joey - . Then help me stay here. (xxx)  81. - Fey - . All right, but just don't go thinkin' like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for?  I mean, the whole thing is for you, Chris.  The whole shootin' match is for you. (xxx)  82. - Joey - . I know.  I know, Mom.  Just help me stay here. (frustrated)  83. - Fey - . All right.  Just-- just don't go thinkin' that way, you hear me? (frustrated)  84. - Joey - . I am thinkin' that way. (neutral)  85. - Fey - . I don't understand you, do I? (frustrated)  86. - Joey - . No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy. (neutral)  87. - Fey - . I can see that. (sad) |
|1.  - Fey - She's been in New York for three and half years.  Why all of a sudden? (xxx) 2. - Joey - . Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again. (neutral)  3. - Fey - . Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see. (xxx)  4. - Joey - . What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again? (neutral)  5. - Joey - . Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you. (xxx)  6. - Fey - . She's not- (xxx)  7. - Joey - . How do you know he's even thinking of it? (neutral)  8. - Fey - . -he's not gonna marry her. (oth)  9. - Fey - . It's got that all about it. (anger)  10. - Joey - . Well, so what? (neutral)  11. - Fey - . What's going on here, Joe? (xxx)  12. - Joey - . Now, listen Kate. (neutral)  13. - Fey - . She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not. (xxx)  14. - Joey - . You can't read her mind. (neutral)  15. - Fey - . Well then why is she still single?  I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited. (frustrated)  16. - Joey - . How do you know why she's waited? (neutral)  17. - Fey - . She knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right. (frustrated)  18. - Joey - . Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for? (frustrated)  19. - Fey - . Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe?  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother. (xxx)  20. - Joey - . Well, what do you want me to do about it? (frustrated)  21. - Fey - . I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense. (frustrated)  22. - Joey - . But Kate-- (frustrated)  23. - Fey - . Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but... (anger)  24. - Fey - . But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it. (anger)  25. - Joey - . Calm yourself. (frustrated)  26. - Fey - . Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone. (frustrated)  27. - Joey - . Calm yourself. (frustrated)  28. - Fey - . Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  I mean, you read it yourself. (frustrated)  29. - Joey - . All right.  All right.  Calm yourself. (frustrated)  30. - Fey - . You, above all, have to believe. (frustrated)  31. - Joey - . What?- Why- Why me above all? (xxx)  32. - Fey - . Just--just don't stop believing. (frustrated)  33. - Joey - . What does that mean?  Me above all? (anger)  34. - Joey - . Look at you.  Look at you shaking. (anger)  35. - Fey - . I can't help it. (frustrated)  36. - Joey - . What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate? (anger) |
|1.  - Fey - It's all right.  It's a good thing. (xxx) 2. - Fey - . You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet. (xxx)  3. - Joey - . Why? (xxx)  4. - Fey - . Well, for one thing, your mother as much as told me to go. (xxx)  5. - Joey - . Oh. (xxx)  6. - Fey - . You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um-- (xxx)  7. - Joey - . What? (xxx)  8. - Fey - . Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here. (xxx)  9. - Joey - . The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But, they take it for granted that we're all set. (xxx)  10. - Fey - . I knew they would, your mother anyway. (xxx)  11. - Fey - . Well, (xxx)  12. - Fey - . from her point of view, why else would I come? (sad)  13. - Joey - . Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know, this is why I asked you to come. (xxx)  14. - Fey - . I--I guess this is why I came. (xxx)  15. - Joey - . Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you. (xxx)  16. - Joey - . I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you. (xxx)  17. - Joey - . I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other. (xxx)  18. - Joey - . You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything. (excited)  19. - Fey - . Oh, Chris, I've been ready for a long, long time. (xxx)  20. - Joey - . And he's gone forever.  You're sure? (xxx)  21. - Fey - . I almost got married two years ago. (happy)  22. - Joey - . Why didn't you? (xxx)  23. - Fey - . You started to write me and-- (happy)  24. - Joey - . You felt something that far back? (xxx)  25. - Fey - . Every day since. (happy)  26. - Joey - . Anne, why didn't you let me know? (xxx)  27. - Fey - . Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, I mean, what did you say?  You can sure be ambiguous sometimes. (xxx)  28. - Joey - . Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a- (xxx)  29. - Joey - . oh God, I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you. (xxx)  30. - Fey - . I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you. (happy)  31. - Joey - . Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm gonna make you so happy. (xxx)  32. - Fey - . Not like that you're not. (xxx)  33. - Joey - . I kissed you. (xxx)  34. - Fey - . Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it? (xxx)  35. - Joey - . Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you. (xxx)  36. - Fey - . No.  What is it, your mother? (xxx)  37. - Joey - . No.  Nothing like that. (sad)  38. - Fey - . Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed. (sad)  39. - Joey - . Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me. (sad)  40. - Fey - . You've gotta tell me. (sad)  41. - Joey - . I don't know how to start. (sad)  42. - Fey - . It wouldn't work this way. (sad)  43. - Joey - . It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company? (sad)  44. - Fey - . Yeah, sure. (sad)  45. - Joey - . Well, I lost them. (sad)  46. - Fey - . How many? (sad)  47. - Joey - . Just about all. (sad)  48. - Fey - . Oh, gee. (sad)  49. - Joey - . It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men. (sad)  50. - Joey - . For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. (sad)  51. - Joey - . They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today. (sad)  52. - Joey - . I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. (sad)  53. - Joey - . You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him. (sad)  54. - Joey - . Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again. (sad)  55. - Joey - . And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator. (sad)  56. - Joey - . I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it. (sad)  57. - Joey - . Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you. (sad)  58. - Fey - . You still feel that way? (sad)  59. - Joey - . I want you now Annie. (xxx)  60. - Fey - . Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything that you have.  Do you understand that?  Everything, Chris, and me too. (xxx)  61. - Fey - . I mean, and your money, there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that. (xxx)  62. - Joey - . I know Annie.  Annie, I'm gonna make a fortune for you. (xxx)  63. - Fey - . What'll I do with a fortune? (happy) |
|1.  - Joey - What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight. (excited) 2. - Joey - . This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better. (excited)  3. - Joey - . I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it. (excited)  4. - Joey - . How you doing? (excited)  5. - Fey - . Fine. (xxx)  6. - Joey - . Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell. (excited)  7. - Joey - . Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think? (excited)  8. - Joey - . How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight. (excited)  9. - Fey - . What flashlight? (neutral)  10. - Joey - . You know, the flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there? (xxx)  11. - Fey - . That's not your flashlight. (xxx)  12. - Joey - . Who's is it? (xxx)  13. - Fey - . It's ours.  It's mine too. (xxx)  14. - Joey - . Oh, well sure. (neutral)  15. - Fey - . You kept saying my flashlight, if as if somehow it's just yours.  I mean is that supposed to make me feel? (xxx)  16. - Joey - . Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally. (neutral)  17. - Joey - . How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out. (xxx)  18. - Joey - . I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember? (neutral)  19. - Fey - . Yeah. (neutral)  20. - Joey - . You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh, we should've brought the blanket.  Our blanket. (neutral)  21. - Joey - . This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now. (excited)  22. - Joey - . I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped. (excited)  23. - Joey - . You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around? (excited)  24. - Fey - . I'm cold. (xxx)  25. - Joey - . Do you want my jacket? (neutral)  26. - Fey - . It's after eleven, let's just go home. (frustrated)  27. - Joey - . Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home. (xxx)  28. - Fey - . There is no point in coming down here. (xxx)  29. - Joey - . Right. (neutral)  30. - Fey - . That's my point. (xxx)  31. - Joey - . That's my point too. (neutral)  32. - Fey - . So, let's go. (xxx)  33. - Joey - . No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it? (neutral)  34. - Fey - . Not particularly. (xxx)  35. - Joey - . Why not? (xxx)  36. - Fey - . I just don't.  It's stupid. (xxx)  37. - Joey - . Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year, you know. (xxx)  38. - Joey - . Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up. (excited)  39. - Fey - . Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die. (frustrated)  40. - Joey - . Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean, (excited)  41. - Joey - . this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. (excited)  42. - Fey - . What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats. (frustrated)  43. - Joey - . Yeah they do. (frustrated)  44. - Fey - . Ah, Augie. (frustrated)  45. - Joey - . Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs. (excited)  46. - Joey - . There's--there's a bit of the magic--some unexplainable here.  I don't see how you can not be interested. (xxx)  47. - Fey - . I'm just not. (frustrated)  48. - Joey - . For real? (xxx)  49. - Fey - . Yeah. (xxx)  50. - Joey - . I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life. (neutral)  51. - Joey - . And last year, I remember specifically you were so excited to go that you stubbed your toe rushing me out of the house and didn't even notice until we got in the car. (xxx)  52. - Fey - . Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions. (frustrated)  53. - Joey - . We weren't in a good spot. (neutral)  54. - Fey - . We didn't see them the first time either. (neutral)  55. - Joey - . We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  Believe me, I've got good instincts for these things. (xxx)  56. - Joey - . There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it? (excited)  57. - Joey - . Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this. (excited)  58. - Joey - . Somewhere out there, this huge mass of silver fish swimming this way. (xxx)  59. - Joey - . They don't know why, we don't know why.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map, it wasn't a decision, just- (xxx)  60. - Joey - . all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters. (excited)  61. - Joey - . It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name. (excited)  62. - Joey - . They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death. (excited)  63. - Joey - . Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up. (excited)  64. - Fey - . That's the wind. (xxx)  65. - Joey - . Well, so what do you think? (neutral)  66. - Fey - . About what? (neutral)  67. - Joey - .

It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact. (neutral)  6. - Fey - . It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is gonna take place on the beach. (xxx)  7. - Joey - . Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people. (neutral)  8. - Fey - . Sure, everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all excited.  It keeps us coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start any second now if we could just find the right spot and get in on the action. (xxx)  9. - Joey - . Are we talking about the same thing? (xxx)  10. - Fey - . Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me. (xxx)  11. - Joey - . Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period? (neutral)  12. - Fey - . God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting. (anger)  13. - Joey - . Well, what's bugging you? (frustrated)  14. - Fey - . We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like. (anger)  15. - Joey - . There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home. (neutral)  16. - Fey - . For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions. (frustrated)  17. - Joey - . Why not? (frustrated)  18. - Fey - . We never do, do we?  I mean, have we ever? (frustrated)  19. - Joey - . We've missed them twice.  That's not ever. (neutral)  20. - Fey - . Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever. (frustrated)  21. - Joey - . Well, we'll see them this year. (neutral)  22. - Fey - . No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus. (frustrated)  23. - Fey - . I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up. (anger)  24. - Joey - . I thought you wanted to see it. (frustrated)  25. - Fey - . You don't understand anything I'm saying. (frustrated)  26. - Joey - . No, of course not. (frustrated)  27. - Fey - . I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is. (frustrated)  28. - Joey - . It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about. (neutral)  29. - Fey - . For heaven sake, this isn't about fish. (xxx)  30. - Joey - . All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst. (frustrated)  31. - Joey - . I mean, you were-  you were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see.  I took a shower.  You watched the news. (xxx)  32. - Joey - . You said, "Hey the grunion are running tonight."  I said, "Great, let's go.  I feel lucky." (neutral)  33. - Joey - . Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-- (neutral)  34. - Fey - . Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married. (sad)  35. - Fey - . I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork. (sad)  36. - Fey - . And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them. (sad)  37. - Fey - . And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be. (sad)  38. - Joey - . Wait a minute.  I've got it. (neutral)  39. - Fey - . Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle. (sad)  40. - Joey - . It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, "let's get some champagne," and I said, "time's a wasting" or something like that, right? (neutral)  41. - Joey - . Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right? (neutral)  42. - Fey - . I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things. (sad)  43. - Joey - . Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance? (neutral)  44. - Fey - . No. (sad)  45. - Joey - .

Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish? (anger)  60. - Joey - . No.  You think I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like a used Kleenex?  Or that I'd look at you and think, holy hell, when's the next flight to Alaska? (xxx)  61. - Joey - . No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us (sad)  62. - Joey - . cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This. (frustrated)  63. - Fey - . This.  What?  What is this?  This isn't even anything. (xxx)  64. - Joey - . Yes, it is. (neutral)  65. - Fey - . Uh, right this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting. (xxx)  66. - Joey - . Right. (neutral)  67. - Fey - . Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like. (sad)  68. - Joey - . I know, me neither. (sad)  69. - Fey - . I mean, this is just this.  It includes a lot and everything, but it isn't something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say? (xxx)  70. - Joey - . I'm doing the best I can. (sad)  71. - Fey - . I know that, Augie.  Really, I do. (sad)  72. - Fey - . I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else. (sad)  73. - Joey - . Maybe if you were with somebody else too. (sad)  74. - Fey - . I didn't say that. (sad)  75. - Joey - . No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy. (sad)  76. - Fey - . Oh, for heaven sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you. (xxx)  77. - Joey - . Yeah? (surprise)  78. - Fey - . Oh, don't be ridiculous.  I mean, don't you know that? (xxx)  79. - Fey - . You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard. (sad)  80. - Joey - . Well, now that you mention it.  No, I don't. (xxx)  81. - Fey - . Okay.  Fine so.  We're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person. (xxx)  82. - Joey - . I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here. (happy)  83. - Fey - . Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon. (xxx)  84. - Joey - . Well, look what we have here. (happy)  85. - Fey - . Augie, you brought refreshments. (happy)  86. - Joey - . It's not champagne. (happy)  87. - Fey - . Well, then we don't need glasses. (happy)  88. - Joey - . You still cold?  Do you wanna go home? (xxx)  89. - Fey - . No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all. (happy)  90. - Fey - . Augie, I'm sorry. (sad)  91. - Joey - . Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come. (happy)  92. - Fey - . Or not. (happy)  93. - Joey - . Or not. (happy) |

Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they? (neutral)  18. - Fey - . What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy. (happy)  19. - Joey - . Oh, darling, don't say that. (neutral)  20. - Fey - . It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke. (happy)  21. - Joey - . Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?

Dear God, what does it all mean? (xxx)  24. - Fey - . Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious. (xxx)  25. - Joey - . You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want. (neutral)  26. - Fey - . Who's they? (neutral)  27. - Joey - . All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths. (neutral)  28. - Joey - . Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light. (neutral)  29. - Fey - . If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too. (neutral)  30. - Joey - . Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright. (neutral)  31. - Fey - . Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours. (neutral)  32. - Joey - . Who knows. (neutral)  33. - Fey - . Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight? (neutral)  34. - Joey - . No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion. (neutral)  35. - Fey - . Oh, dear, shall we like that? (neutral)  36. - Joey - . Depends on how well we've played. (neutral)  37. - Fey - . Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh? (neutral)  38. - Joey - . Yes.  Yes. With all his might. (excited)  39. - Fey - . That's serious enough, isn't it? (xxx)  40. - Joey - . No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors. (excited)  41. - Fey - . Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense. (happy)  42. - Joey - . So is everyone else in the long run. (neutral)  43. - Joey - . Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment. (excited)  44. - Joey - . Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets. (excited)  45. - Fey - . Elliott, worms don't pop. (happy)  46. - Joey - . I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best. (neutral)  47. - Fey - . Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you. (happy)  48. - Joey - . You remember that awful scene we had in Venice? (neutral)  49. - Fey - . Which particular one? (happy)  50. - Joey - . The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed. (neutral)  51. - Fey - . Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully. (happy)  52. - Joey - . Ah, horrible thing.  I hated it. (xxx)  53. - Fey - . Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that. (happy)  54. - Joey - . How long did that row last? (neutral)  55. - Fey - . It went in intermittently for days. (happy)  56. - Joey - . The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown. (neutral)  57. - Fey - . It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom. (happy)  58. - Joey - . That was a rouser, wasn't it? (xxx)  59. - Fey - . That was the first time you ever hit me. (neutral)  60. - Joey - . I didn't hit you very hard. (neutral)  61. - Fey - . The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. (happy)  62. - Joey - . Oh, I'll never forget his face. (excited)  63. - Fey - . It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous. (excited)  64. - Joey - . We were very much younger then. (neutral)  65. - Fey - . and very much sillier (xxx)  66. - Joey - . As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. (neutral) |
|1.  - Joey - I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him. (neutral) 2. - Fey - . Presents?  Just a trivial little broach. (xxx)  3. - Joey - . Ah, yes, I remember it well.  Bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste. (xxx)  4. - Fey - . No, it wasn't.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often. (xxx)  5. - Joey - . You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. (xxx)  6. - Fey - . No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination. (xxx)  7. - Joey - . You must admit, he was in love with you, wasn't he? (xxx)  8. - Fey - . Just a little perhaps, nothing serious. (xxx)  9. - Joey - . You let him kiss you.  You said you did. (xxx)  10. - Fey - . Well, what of it? (xxx)  11. - Joey - . What of it? (anger)  12. - Fey - . It didn't hurt him at all and I enjoyed it. (xxx)  13. - Joey - . Well, what about me? (anger)  14. - Fey - . Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it. (neutral)  15. - Joey - . Well, that's a nice point of view I must say. (xxx)  16. - Fey - .

Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing. (neutral)  23. - Joey - . You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on. (frustrated)  24. - Fey - . Well, it's become a habit with you. (neutral)  25. - Joey - . You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment. (anger)  26. - Fey - . Don't be so stupid.

No, just making myself fascinating for you. (xxx)  32. - Joey - . That reply has broken my heart. (xxx)  33. - Fey - . A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?

I don't care, do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops. (frustrated)  46. - Joey - . Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce? (xxx)  47. - Fey - . Yes, I did.  Quite a lot. (xxx)  48. - Joey - . Hmm, I imagine you let him kiss you a good deal more then. (xxx)  49. - Fey - . Mind your own business.

We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think?  Intemperate tots. (anger)  58. - Fey - . Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy. (frustrated)  59. - Joey - . All right.  I will. (xxx)  60. - Joey - . You better turn that off, I think. (xxx)  61. - Fey - . Why? (anger)  62. - Joey - . Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs. (frustrated)  63. - Fey - . There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio. (frustrated)  64. - Joey - . There are people downstairs I suppose? (frustrated)  65. - Fey - . They're away in Tunis. (xxx)  66. - Joey - . This is no time of the year for Tunis. (frustrated)  67. - Fey - . Turn it on again, please. (anger)  68. - Joey - . I'll do no such thing.

|1.  - Joey - I don't know what I'm going to do about this; I mean (frustrated) 2. - Joey - . I have got to get a job, you know? Like- (frustrated)  3. - Fey - . You've been doing a lot of work for it, right? (neutral)  4. - Joey - . Well, yea you know, I get my resumes and I mean I- (frustrated)  5. - Fey - . Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is - (neutral)  6. - Joey - . I go out all the places I can, every place that'll give an interview you know. (frustrated)  7. - Fey - . you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can. (neutral)  8. - Joey - . But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, or (frustrated)  9. - Fey - . Well, but you care about what you do, right? (neutral)  10. - Joey - . I don't know, I mean why - why (frustrated)  11. - Joey - . Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know. (frustrated)  12. - Fey - . I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh (neutral)  13. - Joey - . Well, and that's what I begin to question after a while is maybe I just don't want it, maybe it's not even worth it, you know, like (xxx)  14. - Joey - . I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know. (frustrated)  15. - Fey - . Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself. (neutral)  16. - Joey - . Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else. (frustrated)  17. - Fey - . You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's (neutral)  18. - Joey - . I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table. (frustrated)  19. - Fey - . Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time. (neutral)  20. - Joey - . I mean, maybe I'm not, you know. I don't have a job. Maybe - maybe I'm not as good as-as I thought I was and (frustrated)  21. - Joey - . I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and (frustrated)  22. - Fey - . I'm sorry. (sad)  23. - Joey - . I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking (sad)  24. - Joey - . maybe - maybe take up painting, I don't know, you know. (frustrated)  25. - Joey - . Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know. (frustrated)  26. - Joey - . Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment. (frustrated)  27. - Fey - . That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like (neutral)  28. - Fey - . and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control. (neutral)  29. - Fey - . So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time. (neutral)  30. - Joey - . I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn't (frustrated)  31. - Fey - . It might be the latter I don't know because you're not the worst, I mean you're great, you very talented at what you do. (xxx)  32. - Joey - . this doesn't happen to a normal person. (anger)  33. - Fey - . You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering. (neutral)  34. - Fey - . But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop. (neutral)  35. - Joey - . I mean, I don't know, I don't see - I don't see any other way - any other way around it right now. (frustrated)  36. - Fey - . Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop. (neutral)  37. - Joey - . What am I going to do on a break? (xxx)  38. - Fey - . Get out of town or something, I mean you need - you need to clear your head 'cause you seem like you're really frustrated about it. I mean you need to like, be excited about you're doing, rather than, you know upset. (xxx)  39. - Joey - . Right. Thanks for talking to me. (sad) |
|1.  - Joey - It seems that uh- my-my bag didn't make it out on the carousel. (neutral) 2. - Fey - . Oh, did you check? Did you make sure as it went around the second time that it- (neutral)  3. - Fey - . Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so- (neutral)  4. - Joey - . Okay. So what-what do I have to get you know (neutral)  5. - Fey - . Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but- (neutral)  6. - Joey - . For some reason, so you think it won't show up? (surprise)  7. - Fey - . Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that (neutral)  8. - Fey - . Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it. (neutral)  9. - Joey - . What? What? How does that happen? (xxx)  10. - Fey - . Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something. (neutral)  11. - Joey - .

Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do- (neutral)  19. - Joey - . Not going to show - well isn't like - wouldn't it just be at the airport, that, like, if it didn't get on the other plane (frustrated)  20. - Joey - . can they check there? (frustrated)  21. - Fey - . Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and (neutral)  22. - Joey - . on another- (xxx)  23. - Fey - . they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that. (neutral)  24. - Fey - . So we'll- what we'll do (neutral)  25. - Joey - . But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and (anger)  26. - Joey - . see where it came from originally. I mean it seems like- (frustrated)  27. - Fey - . Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you. (neutral)  28. - Joey - . Theft? (xxx)  29. - Fey - . Um, so. (neutral)  30. - Joey - . Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with- (anger)  31. - Fey - . We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know (neutral)  32. - Fey - . I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage. (neutral)  33. - Joey - . This is unbelievable. I've got (frustrated)  34. - Joey - . you don't realize the stuff that I've got in that - I really need to get the suitcase okay (anger)  35. - Fey - . I understand, so- (neutral)  36. - Joey - . so if it's back there or something, if there is something you can do (frustrated)  37. - Joey - . I need you to tell me because I really need to get the bag, okay? (frustrated)  38. - Fey - . all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage (neutral)  39. - Fey - . and we will continue to look for it and because your paper- (neutral)  40. - Joey - . You've already checked? Can you check again? [garbage] (frustrated)  41. - Fey - . I've already looked, thank you very much and because we've filled out paperwork if it shows up we will send it to you but otherwise what we can do is reimburse you for fifty dollar. (frustrated)  42. - Joey - . Fifty- fifty dollars? Come on you have got to be joking. (xxx)  43. - Fey - . Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than- (neutral)  44. - Joey - . Uh huh, yea, lost some of my possessions, yes, so if I lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carry-on (frustrated)  45. - Joey - . that might be like fifty dollars okay, but this - I- [garbage] I had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase. (frustrated)  46. - Fey - . The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so- (neutral)  47. - Joey - . The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean- (anger)  48. - Fey - . Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have (neutral)  49. - Fey - . we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely- (neutral)  50. - Joey - . I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do (anger)  51. - Joey - . because this is ridiculous? (frustrated)  52. - Fey - . I'm sorry. I don't- I- (xxx)  53. - Fey - . I don't believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh- in which we can reimburse you and that's all we can do and I'm sorry I've done everything I can- (frustrated)  54. - Joey - . All right. I'm sick- I'm sick of this all right. I'm sick of you and keep your fifty dollar. (frustrated)  55. - Fey - . There's other people waiting- (frustrated)  56. - Fey - . Fine. (xxx) |

|1.  - Fey - How could he see it? I was the first one up he was still in bed. (xxx) 2. - Joey - . He was out here when it broke. (xxx)  3. - Fey - . When? (xxx)  4. - Joey - . About four this morning. I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked. (xxx)  5. - Fey - . What was he doing out here at four in the morning? (xxx)  6. - Joey - . I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen. (sad)  7. - Fey - . So you talked to him? (xxx)  8. - Joey - . No. I figured it was best to leave him alone. (sad)  9. - Fey - . He cried hard? (xxx)  10. - Joey - . I could hear him right through the floor in my room. (sad)  11. - Fey - . What was he doing out here at that hour? He's dreaming about him again, he's walking around at night. (xxx)  12. - Joey - . I guess he is. (xxx)  13. - Fey - . He's getting just like after he died. What is the meaning of that? (xxx)  14. - Joey - . I don't know the meaning of it, but I know one thing mom, we've made a terrible mistake with dad. (xxx)  15. - Fey - . What? (xxx)  16. - Joey - . Being dishonest with him. I mean that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off. (xxx)  17. - Fey - . What do you mean dishonest? (xxx)  18. - Joey - . You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him? (frustrated)  19. - Fey - . What do you want to do, argue with him? (frustrated)  20. - Joey - . No I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore. (frustrated)  21. - Joey - . Why -- why shouldn't he dream of him? Walk around, waiting for him at night I mean do we contradict him, do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore that we haven't had hope for years now? (frustrated)  22. - Fey - . You can't say that to him. (frustrated)  23. - Joey - . We've got to say it to him. (anger)  24. - Fey - . Can you prove it, how can you prove it? (frustrated)  25. - Joey - . For God sakes it's been three years, nobody comes back after three years, that's insane. (anger)  26. - Fey - . To you it is and to me. You can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you? (frustrated)  27. - Joey - . Sit down mom; I want to talk to you. (xxx)  28. - Fey - . The trouble is the god damned newspapers, every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere, so the next one is going to be Larry. (xxx)  29. - Joey - . All right. All right. Listen to me. (frustrated)  30. - Joey - . You know why I brought Annie here don't you? (neutral)  31. - Joey - . You know. (neutral)  32. - Fey - . I got an idea but what's the story? (neutral)  33. - Joey - . I'm going to ask her to marry me. (neutral)  34. - Fey - . Well that's only your business, Chris. (xxx)  35. - Joey - . No it's not only my business. (frustrated)  36. - Fey - . What do you want me to do; you're old enough to know your own mind. (frustrated)  37. - Joey - . So it's all right then I'll go ahead with it? (frustrated)  38. - Fey - . Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't- (neutral)  39. - Joey - . See it isn't just my business- (anger)  40. - Fey - . I'm just saying (frustrated)  41. - Joey - . Sometimes you infuriate me you know that. Isn't it your business to if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it? You have such a talent for ignoring things. (xxx)  42. - Fey - . I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl. (xxx)  43. - Joey - . She's not Larry's girl. (frustrated)  44. - Fey - . From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl. (neutral)  45. - Fey - . You can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go, see I don't know. So what can I do for you? (frustrated)  46. - Joey - . I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time. (anger)  47. - Fey - . You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that. (neutral)  48. - Joey - . To hell with that. (anger)  49. - Fey - . Have you asked Annie yet? (frustrated)  50. - Joey - . I wanted to get this settled first. (neutral)  51. - Fey - . How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does. (neutral)  52. - Joey - . Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him. (neutral)  53. - Joey - . I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me. (sad)  54. - Fey - . Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did. (anger)  55. - Joey - . So what I'm not fast with women. (frustrated)  56. - Fey - . I just don't see why it has to be Annie. (anger)  57. - Joey - . Because it is. (frustrated)  58. - Fey - . That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. I mean you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's five years. (frustrated)  59. - Joey - . I can't help it I know her best. I mean lived next door to her my whole life. These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie. (frustrated)  60. - Joey - . What do you want, a diagram? (xxx)  61. - Fey - . I don't want a diagram. He thinks he's coming back. Chris, you marry this girl you're pronouncing him dead. (frustrated)  62. - Fey - . Do you know what's going to happen to your father because I don't, see? (frustrated)  63. - Joey - . All right. All right. Mom. (xxx)  64. - Fey - . Just give it some more thought. (xxx)  65. - Joey - . I've given it three years of thought. I thought that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy. (xxx)  66. - Joey - . If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out. (sad)  67. - Fey - . What the hell is this? (anger)  68. - Joey - . I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York. (sad)  69. - Fey - . What the hell is this, are you crazy? (anger)  70. - Joey - . I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it. (anger)  71. - Fey - . What about the business? What is this? (anger)  72. - Joey - . The business?  The business doesn't inspire me. (anger)  73. - Fey - . Must you be inspired? (anger)  74. - Joey - . Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful. (anger)  75. - Fey - . Tell me, you'd leave the business? (anger)  76. - Joey - . Yes, on this I would. (sad)  77. - Fey - . Well, you don't want to think like that. (anger)  78. - Joey - . Then help me stay here. (frustrated)  79. - Fey - . All right. But you don't want to be thinking like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for, I mean the whole thing is for you, Chris, the whole shooting match is for you. (xxx)  80. - Joey - . I know I know mom. All right. Just help me stay here. (frustrated)  81. - Fey - . Just don't go thinking that way. (frustrated)  82. - Joey - . Well, I am thinking that way. (frustrated)  83. - Fey - . I don't understand you, do I? (frustrated)  84. - Joey - . No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy. (xxx)  85. - Fey - . Yea, I can see that. (sad) |
|1.  - Fey - Why did he invite her here? (anger) 2. - Joey - . Why does that bother you? (xxx)  3. - Fey - . She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden- (anger)  4. - Joey - . Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again. (neutral)  5. - Fey - . Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see. (anger)  6. - Joey - . What do you mean? He lived next door to the girl all his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? (frustrated)  7. - Joey - . Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you. (frustrated)  8. - Fey - . He's not going to marry her. (anger)  9. - Joey - . How do you know he's even thinking of it? (neutral)  10. - Fey - . It's got that all about it. (xxx)  11. - Joey - . Well, so what? (neutral)  12. - Fey - . What's going on here Joe? (anger)  13. - Joey - . All right. Now, listen kid- (xxx)  14. - Fey - . -She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not. (anger)  15. - Joey - . You can't read her mind. (neutral)  16. - Fey - . Then why is she still single, I mean New York is full of men, why isn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy but she's waited. (frustrated)  17. - Joey - . How do you know why she has waited? (frustrated)  18. - Fey - . She knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right. (frustrated)  19. - Joey - . Look it's a nice day, what are we arguing for? (frustrated)  20. - Fey - . Nobody in this house dares take her faith away Joe. Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother. (frustrated)  21. - Joey - . What do you want me to do about it? (frustrated)  22. - Fey - . I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense (anger)  23. - Joey - . But Kate (frustrated)  24. - Fey - . Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. And laugh -- laugh at me but (frustrated)  25. - Fey - . why did that happen the very night she came back she sleeps in his room and suddenly his memorial breaks to pieces, just look at it, look. (xxx)  26. - Joey - . Calm yourself. (frustrated)  27. - Fey - . I need you to believe with me; I can't stand all alone. (sad)  28. - Joey - . Calm yourself. (frustrated)  29. - Fey - . Even last week there was a man who showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself. (frustrated)  30. - Joey - . All right. All right. Calm yourself. (frustrated)  31. - Fey - . Just you above all need to believe. (frustrated)  32. - Joey - . Wait, why my above all? (xxx)  33. - Fey - . Don't stop believing. (frustrated)  34. - Joey - . What does that mean, me above all? (anger)  35. - Joey - . Look at you -- look at you shaking. (anger)  36. - Fey - . I can't help it. (frustrated)  37. - Joey - . What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?

(happy)  7. - Joey - . Why? (xxx)  8. - Fey - . For one thing, your mother as much as told me to go. (xxx)  9. - Joey - . Oh. (xxx)  10. - Fey - . You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um-- (xxx)  11. - Joey - . What? (surprise)  12. - Fey - . Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here. (xxx)  13. - Joey - . The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you on a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set. (frustrated)  14. - Fey - . I knew they would, your mother anyway. (happy)  15. - Joey - . How'd you know? (xxx)  16. - Fey - . Well, from her point of view, why else would I come? (neutral)  17. - Joey - . Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know, this is why I asked you to come. (xxx)  18. - Fey - . I guess this is why I came. (happy)  19. - Joey - . Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you. (xxx)  20. - Joey - . I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you. (xxx)  21. - Joey - . I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other. (excited)  22. - Joey - . You feel wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything. (xxx)  23. - Fey - . Oh, Chris, I've been ready for a long, long time. (xxx)  24. - Joey - . And he's gone forever.  You're sure? (xxx)  25. - Fey - . I almost got married two years ago. (xxx)  26. - Joey - . Why didn't you? (surprise)  27. - Fey - . Well, you started to write me (happy)  28. - Joey - . You felt something that far back? (excited)  29. - Fey - . Every day since. (happy)  30. - Joey - . Ann, why didn't you let me know? (excited)  31. - Fey - . Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you can sure be ambiguous sometimes, you know? (xxx)  32. - Joey - . Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a- (xxx)  33. - Joey - . God, I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you. (xxx)  34. - Fey - . I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  I mean, all I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you. (xxx)  35. - Joey - . Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm gonna make you so happy. (xxx)  36. - Fey - . Not like that you're not. (xxx)  37. - Joey - . I kissed you. (xxx)  38. - Fey - . Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it? (xxx)  39. - Joey - . Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you. (sad)  40. - Fey - . No.  What is it, Chris. Your mother? (xxx)  41. - Joey - . No.  Nothing like that. (sad)  42. - Fey - . Well, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed. (sad)  43. - Joey - . Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me. (sad)  44. - Fey - . You've gotta tell me. (xxx)  45. - Joey - . I don't know how to start. (xxx)  46. - Fey - . It wouldn't work this way. (sad)  47. - Joey - . It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in charge of a company? (xxx)  48. - Fey - . Yeah, sure. (xxx)  49. - Joey - . Well, I lost them. (sad)  50. - Fey - . How many? (xxx)  51. - Joey - . Just about all. (sad)  52. - Fey - . gee. (xxx)  53. - Joey - . It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men. (sad)  54. - Joey - . For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had. (sad)  55. - Joey - . They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today. (sad)  56. - Joey - . To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him. (sad)  57. - Joey - . Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again. (sad)  58. - Joey - . And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator. (sad)  59. - Joey - . I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it. (sad)  60. - Joey - . Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you. (sad)  61. - Fey - . Do you still feel that way? (sad)  62. - Joey - . I want you now Annie. (neutral)  63. - Fey - . Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris.  Everything, you understand that?  Me too. (sad)  64. - Fey - . I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that. (sad)  65. - Joey - . I know Annie.  I'm gonna make a fortune for you. (xxx)  66. - Fey - . What'll I do with a fortune? (happy) |

(excited)  5. - Fey - . Fine. (neutral)  6. - Joey - . Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell. (excited)  7. - Joey - . Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think? (excited)  8. - Joey - . How you doing? You know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How - how could I forget to bring my flashlight? How could I be so stupid? (excited)  9. - Fey - . What flashlight? (neutral)  10. - Joey - . You know the flashlight, the silver one, there is only one, isn't there? (frustrated)  11. - Fey - . That's not your flashlight. (frustrated)  12. - Joey - . Who's is it? (frustrated)  13. - Fey - . It's ours; it's mine too. (frustrated)  14. - Joey - . Oh well, sure, yes. (xxx)  15. - Fey - . But you kept saying my flashlight as if somehow it's just yours. I mean how is it supposed to make me feel? (frustrated)  16. - Joey - . No. No. Of course our flashlight yours and mine. Mi flashlight, es su flashlight, naturally. (xxx)  17. - Joey - . How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out. (xxx)  18. - Joey - . I wonder do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year, do you remember? (xxx)  19. - Fey - . Yea. (neutral)  20. - Joey - . You cold, you want my jacket? We should've - we should've brought our blanket, our blanket, how could we forget to bring the blanket? (excited)  21. - Joey - . Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget, (excited)  22. - Joey - . oh man. Like a kid, it's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped. (excited)  23. - Joey - . You think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around? (excited)  24. - Fey - . I'm cold. (neutral)  25. - Joey - . What you want my jacket? (xxx)  26. - Fey - . It's after eleven. Let's just go home. (frustrated)  27. - Joey - . Are you kidding, we'd miss it. We, we just got here. What's the point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home? (frustrated)  28. - Fey - . There is no point in coming down here. (frustrated)  29. - Joey - . Right. (xxx)  30. - Fey - . That's my point. (frustrated)  31. - Joey - . That's my point too. (xxx)  32. - Fey - . So let's go. (frustrated)  33. - Joey - . No. No. That's not my point. The point is there is no point in coming down here if we just leave. Don't you want to see it? (xxx)  34. - Fey - . Not particularly. (neutral)  35. - Joey - . Why not? (surprise)  36. - Fey - . I don't, it's just stupid. (frustrated)  37. - Joey - . Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year. (excited)  38. - Joey - . Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up. (excited)  39. - Fey - . Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach flop around and swim away, and then they die. (frustrated)  40. - Joey - . Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that. (excited)  41. - Joey - . This is a big night for these guys, life's last orgy. (excited)  42. - Fey - . What are you so excited about? I mean it's not a moon landing we're talking about here it's fish. It's a fish nobody even eats. (frustrated)  43. - Joey - . Yes they do. (frustrated)  44. - Fey - . Augie (frustrated)  45. - Joey - . Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs (excited)  46. - Joey - . you know there is like, there is a certain mystery here, a magic, a bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you cannot be interested. (excited)  47. - Fey - . I'm just not. (sad)  48. - Joey - . For real? (surprise)  49. - Fey - . Yes. (neutral)  50. - Joey - . I don't get it. The first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life. (xxx)  51. - Joey - . And then last year I remember specifically you were so excited that you stubbed your toe on the way pushing me out of the house, and you didn't even notice until we got in the car. (frustrated)  52. - Fey - . Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions. (anger)  53. - Joey - . We weren't in a good spot. (xxx)  54. - Fey - . We didn't see them the first time either. (frustrated)  55. - Joey - . We just weren't in a good spot; this is a much better spot. I've got good instincts for these things. (frustrated)  56. - Joey - . There is that, oh no that's just seaweed, isn't it? (excited)  57. - Joey - . This is, this is great, isn't it? I wouldn't miss this for anything. Now listen to this, I know you're not interested but just listen. (excited)  58. - Joey - . Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way, (excited)  59. - Joey - . they don't why, we don't know why. They didn't take a vote or anything; they didn't get a map or an invitation. (excited)  60. - Joey - . Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker, instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the California coast and started swimming. They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters. (excited)  61. - Joey - . It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question, (excited)  62. - Joey - . they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death. (excited)  63. - Joey - . Look at me; I'm giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up. (excited)  64. - Fey - . That's the wind. (neutral)  65. - Joey - . Well, so what do you think? (xxx)  66. - Fey - . About what? (neutral)  67. - Joey - . What I was saying. (xxx)  68. - Fey - . It's ridiculous. (frustrated) |
|1.  - Joey - So what do you think? (neutral) 2. - Fey - . About what? (xxx)  3. - Joey - . What I was saying. (neutral)  4. - Fey - . It's ridiculous. (frustrated)  5. - Joey - . Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact. (neutral)  6. - Fey - . It's PR. Someone sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach. (xxx)  7. - Joey - . Well, I'm not the only one look at all these people. (xxx)  8. - Fey - . Yea, sure everyone was sold the same story. I mean it keeps us all excited, keeps us coming back for more, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any second now if we can just get in on the action and find the right spot. (xxx)  9. - Joey - . Are we talking about the same thing? (xxx)  10. - Fey - . I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me. (xxx)  11. - Joey - . Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong but are you having your period? (frustrated)  12. - Fey - . Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting. (anger)  13. - Joey - . Well, what's bugging you? (frustrated)  14. - Fey - . We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like. (anger)  15. - Joey - . There is nothing to it, we come here, the Grunion arrive, then do their little fish business, we go oh ah look, they go home, we go home. (frustrated)  16. - Fey - . For heavens sake we are not going to see the Grunions. (frustrated)  17. - Joey - . Why not? (frustrated)  18. - Fey - . We never do, do we? I mean have we ever? (frustrated)  19. - Joey - . We've missed them twice; that's not ever. (frustrated)  20. - Fey - . Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever. (frustrated)  21. - Joey - . Well, we'll see them this year. (neutral)  22. - Fey - . No we won't; it's pointless. It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus, (frustrated)  23. - Fey - . I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up. (anger)  24. - Joey - . I thought you wanted to see them. (frustrated)  25. - Fey - . You don't understand anything I'm saying. (frustrated)  26. - Joey - . No of course not. (frustrated)  27. - Fey - . I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is. (anger)  28. - Joey - . It's just fish, I mean nothing to get traumatized over. (xxx)  29. - Fey - . For heavens sake this isn't about fish. (frustrated)  30. - Joey - . All right. I've been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst. (frustrated)  31. - Joey - . You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said (neutral)  32. - Joey - . the Grunion are running tonight, I said "great, let's go, I feel lucky," (neutral)  33. - Joey - . okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage- (neutral)  34. - Fey - . Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married. (sad)  35. - Fey - . We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork. (sad)  36. - Fey - . And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them (sad)  37. - Fey - . and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be (sad)  38. - Joey - . Wait a minute I've got it (xxx)  39. - Fey - . Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle. (sad)  40. - Joey - . It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right? (excited)  41. - Joey - . Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right? (excited)  42. - Fey - . I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things. (sad)  43. - Joey - . Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance? (neutral)  44. - Fey - . No. (sad)  45. - Joey - . You want to go get some champagne? (neutral)  46. - Fey - . No. (sad)  47. - Joey - . Take off our shoes? (neutral)  48. - Fey - . No. (xxx)  49. - Joey - . What, you want me to breathe in your ear? (xxx)  50. - Fey - . No. (xxx)  51. - Joey - . Get married again? (neutral)  52. - Fey - . No. (frustrated)  53. - Joey - . What? What? You want a divorce? (frustrated)  54. - Fey - . No. (frustrated)  55. - Joey - . A vacation? (frustrated)  56. - Fey - . No. (frustrated)  57. - Joey - . A new carpet? A poodle, a ice cream, backrub, a suicide pact, what, what Carla, what the hell do you want? (frustrated)  58. - Fey - . I want something to turn out the way that it supposed to. (frustrated)  59. - Joey - . Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish? (anger)  60. - Joey - . You think I knew that there be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex, or that I'd look at you and think holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska? (xxx)  61. - Joey - . No, no, just like you I thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three, fat, rosy kids and ha-ha baby the joke is on us (frustrated)  62. - Joey - . cause you know what you get Carla, you know what you get? This. (frustrated)  63. - Fey - . This? What, what is this? This isn't even anything. (frustrated)  64. - Joey - . Yes, it is. (xxx)  65. - Fey - . I'm sure, this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, this is fighting. (frustrated)  66. - Joey - . Right. (xxx)  67. - Fey - . Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like. (sad)  68. - Joey - . No, I know. Me neither. (sad)  69. - Fey - . I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say? (frustrated)  70. - Joey - . I'm doing the best I can. (xxx)  71. - Fey - . I know that Augie. Really I do. (xxx)  72. - Fey - . I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else. (sad)  73. - Joey - . Maybe if you were with somebody else too. (sad)  74. - Fey - . I didn't say that. (xxx)  75. - Joey - . No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy. (sad)  76. - Fey - . For heavens sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you. (xxx)  77. - Joey - . Yeah? (xxx)  78. - Fey - . Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that? (happy)  79. - Fey - . You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard. (sad)  80. - Joey - . Now that you mention it. No, I don't. (happy)  81. - Fey - . Okay.  Fine, so we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person. (xxx)  82. - Joey - . I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here. (happy)  83. - Fey - . Yes, I noticed that. It looks pretty on the water doesn't it? Big old white moon. (xxx)  84. - Joey - . What have we got here? (happy)  85. - Fey - . Augie, you brought refreshments. (xxx)  86. - Joey - . It's not champagne. (xxx)  87. - Fey - . Well, I guess we don't need glasses. (happy)  88. - Joey - . You still cold? Do you want my jacket? Do you want to go home? (xxx)  89. - Fey - . No. No. I think you might be right. I think this may be the spot after all. (xxx)  90. - Fey - . Augie, I'm sorry. (sad)  91. - Joey - . Shh, if we're very quiet the fish might come. (happy)  92. - Fey - . Or not. (happy)  93. - Joey - . Or not. (happy)  94. - Fey - . Hmm. (neutral) |

(happy)  15. - Fey - . Yes, I should probably to a court curtsey. (happy)  16. - Joey - . Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy, do they? (happy)  17. - Fey - . What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy. (xxx)  18. - Joey - . Oh darling don't say that. (sad)  19. - Fey - . It's true; the whole business is a very poor joke. (xxx)  20. - Joey - . Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love? (happy)  21. - Fey - . Yes. Meaning just that. (xxx)  22. - Joey - . What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth?  Good God what does it all mean? (happy)  23. - Fey - . Don't laugh at me. I'm serious. (xxx)  24. - Joey - . You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want. (excited)  25. - Fey - . Who's they? (excited)  26. - Joey - . All those futile moralists, who try to make life unbearable, laugh at them, be flippant. Laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths (xxx)  27. - Joey - . flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light. (excited)  28. - Fey - . Well, if I laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too. (xxx)  29. - Joey - . Certainly you must, we figures of fun all right. (excited)  30. - Fey - . Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight? (xxx)  31. - Joey - . No, that desire will fade along with our passion. (sad)  32. - Fey - . Oh dear, should we like that? (sad)  33. - Joey - . Depends on how well we play it. (xxx)  34. - Fey - . Well, what happens if one of us dies, does the one that's left still laugh? (fear)  35. - Joey - . Yes, yes, with all his might. (excited)  36. - Fey - . Well that's serious enough, isn't it? (xxx)  37. - Joey - . No, no it isn't, death is very laughable, such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors. (excited)  38. - Fey - . Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense. (xxx)  39. - Joey - . So is everyone else in the long run. (excited)  40. - Joey - . Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers, let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can. Like quite idiotic, very small, school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. (excited)  41. - Joey - . Come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets. (excited)  42. - Fey - . Elliot, worms don't pop. (xxx)  43. - Joey - . I don't care what you do see. You can paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome, and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word, as long as you love me best. (xxx)  44. - Fey - . Thank you dear, the same applies you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you. (xxx)  45. - Joey - . You remember that awful scene we had in Venice? (happy)  46. - Fey - . Which particular one? (happy)  47. - Joey - . The one when you bought that little, painted, wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed. (xxx)  48. - Fey - . Oh Charles, that was his name Charles. It did wiggle so beautifully. (happy)  49. - Joey - . Horrible thing, I hated it. (xxx)  50. - Fey - . I know you did.

It went on intermittently for days. (happy)  53. - Joey - . The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burned a hole in my new dressing gown. (xxx)  54. - Fey - . It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom. (happy)  55. - Joey - . That was a rouser, wasn't it? (happy)  56. - Fey - . That was the first time you ever hit me. (xxx)  57. - Joey - . I didn't hit you very hard. (xxx)  58. - Fey - . The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers. (happy)  59. - Joey - . I'll never forget his face. (happy)  60. - Fey - . Oh it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous. (happy)  61. - Joey - . We were very much younger then. (xxx)  62. - Fey - . And very much sillier. (happy)  63. - Joey - . As a matter of fact the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. (xxx) |

I expect it's because you're drunk. (xxx)  55. - Joey - . I am not in the least drunk. (xxx)  56. - Joey - . I imagine, as I may have already mentioned, I've had three minute liquor glasses of Brandy the whole evening long a child of two couldn't get drunk on that. (xxx)  57. - Fey - . On the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of Brandy. (xxx)  58. - Joey - . Oh very interesting. How about a child of four, a child of six or a child of nine? (xxx)  59. - Fey - . Oh be quiet. (anger)  60. - Joey - . We can get a good little debate going about that, don't you think? Intemperate tots. (anger)  61. - Fey - .

I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now. (sad)  54. - Fey - . You should tell me. (sad)  55. - Joey - . I don't know where to start. (sad)  56. - Fey - . But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this. (sad)  57. - Joey - . You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company. (sad)  58. - Fey - . Yeah, sure. (sad)  59. - Joey - . Well, I lost them. (sad)  60. - Fey - . How many? (sad)  61. - Joey - . Just about all. (sad)  62. - Fey - . Geez. (sad)  63. - Joey - . It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men. (sad)  64. - Joey - . For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket. (sad)  65. - Joey - . I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today. (sad)  66. - Joey - . And I, and I thought something watching them go down. (sad)  67. - Joey - . Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me? (sad)  68. - Joey - . And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him. (sad)  69. - Joey - . And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident. (sad)  70. - Joey - . And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys. (sad)  71. - Joey - . And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that. (sad)  72. - Joey - . Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it. (sad)  73. - Joey - . And I didn't want to take any of it. (sad)  74. - Joey - . And I guess that included you. (sad)  75. - Fey - . And you still feel that way? (sad)  76. - Joey - . I want you now, Annie. (xxx)  77. - Fey - . Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too. (sad)  78. - Fey - . I mean, there's nothing wrong in that money, and your father put good planes up in the air and you should be proud of that. A man should be paid for that. (xxx)  79. - Joey - . Annie, (happy)  80. - Joey - . Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you. (happy)  81. - Fey - . What am I going to do with a fortune? (happy) |
|1.  - Joey - Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it? (excited) 2. - Joey - . Look at the night we got; couldn't be better. (excited)  3. - Joey - . You know actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the, the people and the lights, and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey, how you doing? (excited)  4. - Fey - . Fine. (sad)  5. - Joey - . Oh, is that-is that-now, is that just foam, uhh, I can't even tell. (excited)  6. - Joey - . Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing? (excited)  7. - Joey - . Oh, do you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid. Oh, I-I should have brought my flashlight. (excited)  8. - Fey - . What flashlight? (xxx)  9. - Joey - . Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there? (excited)  10. - Fey - . That's not your flashlight; it's ours. It's mine too. (xxx)  11. - Joey - . Oh, well, sure. (xxx)  12. - Fey - . I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel? (anger)  13. - Joey - . No, of course. Yours and mine. Our flashlight. Yours and mine. Mi flashlight is su flashlight. Naturally. (xxx)  14. - Joey - . We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it. (excited)  15. - Joey - . I hope the moon stays out. (excited)  16. - Joey - . Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember? (excited)  17. - Fey - . Yes. (xxx)  18. - Joey - . Are you cold? Do you want my jacket? (xxx)  19. - Joey - . We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket. (excited)  20. - Joey - . You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now. (excited)  21. - Joey - . I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER]. (excited)  22. - Joey - . I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move. (excited)  23. - Fey - . I'm cold. (xxx)  24. - Joey - . Do you want my jacket? (neutral)  25. - Fey - . It's past eleven, let's go home. (xxx)  26. - Joey - . What? Are you kidding me? We just got here. We'd miss it. What's the point of coming down there if we just turn around and go home? (surprise)  27. - Fey - . There is no point in coming down here. (xxx)  28. - Joey - . Right. (neutral)  29. - Fey - . That's my point. (xxx)  30. - Joey - . Yeah, that's my point too. (neutral)  31. - Fey - . Well, so let's go. (xxx)  32. - Joey - . No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave. (excited)  33. - Joey - . I mean, don't you want to see it? (neutral)  34. - Fey - . Not particularly. (sad)  35. - Joey - . Why not? (neutral)  36. - Fey - . I don't know. I just don't. (sad)  37. - Joey - . Honey, this is a natural-this is a natural phenomenon. I mean, it only happens once a year. This is, this is a great opportunity. Think about the people in Kansas. They would have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservation to come and see this. We're only forty minutes away. This is too good to pass up. (xxx)  38. - Fey - . Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die. (anger)  39. - Joey - . Yeah. But that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. And all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you-spawning or mating or something like that. (xxx)  40. - Joey - . I mean, this is the big night for these guys. Life's last orgy. (xxx)  41. - Fey - . I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean, it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats. (frustrated)  42. - Joey - . Yeah, they do. (xxx)  43. - Fey - . Oh, God, Augie. (frustrated)  44. - Joey - . What, okay, then it's fish that do something no other fish do. Like the swallows in Capistrano or the lemmings who throw themselves off the cliffs. (xxx)  45. - Joey - . There's magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable. I mean, I don't see how you cannot be interested. (xxx)  46. - Fey - . I'm just not. I mean, I'm sorry, it just-they're still fish to me. (xxx)  47. - Joey - . For real? (surprise)  48. - Fey - . Yes. (xxx)  49. - Joey - . I don't get it. The last time-the first time that we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life. (xxx)  50. - Joey - . And then last year when we came to see it you ran out of the house so fast that you stubbed your toe. And you didn't even notice until you got in the car. (xxx)  51. - Fey - . Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions. (frustrated)  52. - Joey - . We weren't in a good spot. (xxx)  53. - Fey - . No, for God's sakes, we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them. (frustrated)  54. - Joey - . We just weren't in a good spot, all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look, is that- (frustrated)  55. - Joey - . no, that's just seaweed, isn't it? This is great, isn't it? (xxx)  56. - Joey - . I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute. (excited)  57. - Joey - . Somewhere out there there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way. They don't know why. And we don't know why. Just some little instinctual time-release firecracker went off-went off in their bodies. (xxx)  58. - Joey - . And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters. (excited)  59. - Joey - . You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one. (excited)  60. - Joey - . its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name. (excited)  61. - Joey - . They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here (excited)  62. - Joey - . where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, God, I'm giving myself goosebumps. Look, I'm all-all my hairs on my arms is sticking up. (excited)  63. - Fey - . Yeah, that's the wind. (xxx)  64. - Joey - . So what do you think? (xxx)  65. - Fey - . About what? (xxx)  66. - Joey - . About what I just said. (neutral)  67. - Fey - . It's ridiculous. (xxx) |
|1.  - Fey - And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words. (happy) 2. - Fey - . Oh, that moment-that was it. (happy)  3. - Fey - . I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be. (sad)  4. - Joey - . Wait a minute. I got it. (neutral)  5. - Fey - . Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne. (happy)  6. - Joey - . It was driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, right? You said let's get some champagne, and I said time's-a-wasting or something like that. (xxx)  7. - Joey - . You want this to be like the other time, right? That's it. Right? (xxx)  8. - Fey - . I don't want to remember something. (sad)  9. - Fey - . Hope for some things. (sad)  10. - Joey - . Right. I got it. Of course. Listen, do you want to dance? (xxx)  11. - Fey - . No. (sad)  12. - Joey - . Do you want me to get some champagne? (xxx)  13. - Fey - . No. (sad)  14. - Joey - . Take off our shoes? (xxx)  15. - Fey - . No, no. (sad)  16. - Joey - . What? What? Do you want me to breathe in your ear? (frustrated)  17. - Fey - . No. (frustrated)  18. - Joey - . Do you want to get married again? What? What? Do you want to get a divorce? (frustrated)  19. - Fey - . No. (frustrated)  20. - Fey - . No. (anger)  21. - Joey - . A vacation? (frustrated)  22. - Fey - . No. (frustrated)  23. - Joey - . A new carpet? A poodle? (frustrated)  24. - Joey - . A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla? (anger)  25. - Fey - . I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be. (frustrated)  26. - Joey - . Jesus, welcome to the human race. (frustrated)  27. - Joey - . Did you think this is how I thought it was going to turn out? Do you think I had some great fantasy down the line? That four years down the line that we'd come to the beach and argue with each other over fish? (xxx)  28. - Joey - . No, I was just like you. I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great. And the wind in our hair and the sand in our toes, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves, and we'll have three big fat rosy kids. And oh God. (frustrated)  29. - Joey - . You know what you get? The jokes on us, baby. Because do you know what you get? Huh? Carla? Do you know what you get? You get this. (frustrated)  30. - Fey - . This what? What is this? This is nothing. (frustrated)  31. - Joey - . Yes, it is. (frustrated)  32. - Fey - . No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting. (anger)  33. - Joey - . Right. (frustrated)  34. - Fey - . Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be. (sad)  35. - Joey - . No, I know. Me neither. (frustrated)  36. - Fey - . I mean, this is, this is everything, and it's a lot, but (xxx)  37. - Fey - . it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say? (sad)  38. - Joey - . Well, I'm doing the best I can. (frustrated)  39. - Fey - . I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else. (sad)  40. - Joey - . Yeah, maybe if you were with someone else too. (frustrated)  41. - Fey - . I didn't say that. (sad)  42. - Joey - . No, I know. But I know I don't make you happy. (xxx)  43. - Fey - . Augie, anything I do I'd rather be doing with you. (frustrated)  44. - Joey - . Yeah? (surprise)  45. - Fey - . God, don't you know that? I mean, you're the one that probably wants to be with somebody else. Somebody that didn't take herself so seriously, could enjoy herself more. (frustrated)  46. - Joey - . Actually now that you mention it, no, I don't. (happy)  47. - Fey - . Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person. (happy)  48. - Joey - . Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here. (happy)  49. - Fey - . I noticed that. It's beautiful. (happy)  50. - Fey - . You can see right over the water. (happy)  51. - Fey - . God, big old white moon. (xxx)  52. - Joey - . Look what we got here. (happy)  53. - Fey - . You brought refreshments? (xxx)  54. - Joey - . It's not champagne. (happy)  55. - Fey - . At least we won't need glasses. (happy)  56. - Joey - . Are you still cold? Do you want to go home? (neutral)  57. - Fey - . So I was thinking you might be right. (xxx)  58. - Fey - . Maybe this is the right place after all. (happy)  59. - Fey - . I'm sorry, Augie. (sad)  60. - Joey - . Shh. (neutral)  61. - Joey - . If we're very quiet the fish might come. (happy)  62. - Fey - . Or not. (xxx)  63. - Joey - . Or not. (happy) |

Well, if I laugh at everything I'm going to have to laugh at us too. (xxx)  14. - Joey - . Ooh, certainly you must. We're figures of fun, all right. (excited)  15. - Fey - . Shall we always want to bicker and fight? (xxx)  16. - Joey - . No. The fire will fade along with our passion. (xxx)  17. - Fey - . Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh? (sad)  18. - Joey - . Yes, yes. Yes, he must with all his might. (xxx)  19. - Fey - . Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense. (xxx)  20. - Joey - . So is everyone else in the long run. Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers. (xxx)  21. - Joey - . I don't care what you do, see? As long-you can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best. (xxx)  22. - Fey - . Thank you, dear. The same applies to you. Except that if I ever so much as catch you looking at another woman I'll kill you. (excited)  23. - Joey - . The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed. (xxx)  24. - Fey - . Oh Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully.

|1.  - Joey - As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. (anger) 2. - Fey - . Presents? It was only a small trivial little broach. (xxx)  3. - Joey - . You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. (xxx)  4. - Fey - . Just a little perhaps, but it was nothing serious. (neutral)  5. - Joey - . What of it? (xxx)  6. - Fey - . Oh come on, it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't harm me. (xxx)  7. - Joey - . What about me? (anger)  8. - Fey - . Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you'd have never known anything about it. (xxx)  9. - Joey - . Are you bored with this conversation? (neutral)  10. - Fey - . I definitely, most definitely am. (xxx)  11. - Joey - . So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy? (neutral)  12. - Fey - . No, thanks. (xxx)  13. - Joey - . No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones. (neutral)  14. - Fey - . I don't see what's the point of going on and on about something like this. (xxx)  15. - Joey - . Oh, my-you can hardly call three minute liquor glasses in the evening going on and on and on. (xxx)  16. - Fey - . It's become a habit with you. (neutral)  17. - Joey - . Really, Amanda. (anger)  18. - Fey - . What? (anger)  19. - Joey - . Nothing. (anger)  20. - Joey - . Going somewhere, dear? (anger)  21. - Fey - . It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute? (neutral)  22. - Joey - . As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true. (xxx)  23. - Fey - . No, it isn't. (anger)  24. - Joey - . Yes, it is. (anger)  25. - Fey - . Well, it didn't seem to do such wonders with you, now did it? (xxx)  26. - Joey - . Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder. (xxx)  27. - Fey - . Adders don't snap, they sting. (frustrated)  28. - Joey - . Yes, they do. They have a big bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. (xxx)  29. - Fey - . I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops. (anger)  30. - Joey - . Uhh, (xxx)  31. - Joey - . did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce? (anger)  32. - Fey - . Yes, I did, quite a lot actually. (xxx)  33. - Joey - . You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow. (anger)  34. - Fey - . You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk. (anger)  35. - Joey - . I'm not in the least bit drunk. (anger)  36. - Fey - . You've always had a weak head. (frustrated)  37. - Joey - . Oh, very interesting indeed. How about a child of four or a child of six or a child of nine. We might have a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.

Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men. (sad)  55. - Joey - . A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created. (sad)  56. - Joey - . It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me? (sad)  57. - Joey - . And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him. (sad)  58. - Joey - . And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident. (sad)  59. - Joey - . And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all. (sad)  60. - Joey - . It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook, (sad)  61. - Joey - . open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator (sad)  62. - Joey - . cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that. (sad)  63. - Joey - . Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it. (sad)  64. - Joey - . And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you. (sad)  65. - Fey - . And you still feel that way? (sad)  66. - Joey - . I want you now Annie. (xxx)  67. - Fey - . Cause you must not feel that way again.  You hear me?  You can't.  You deserve everything you have Chris. (xxx)  68. - Fey - . that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that. (sad)  69. - Joey - . [GARBAGE] Annie (xxx)  70. - Joey - . Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you. (happy)  71. - Fey - . What am I going to do with a fortune? (happy)  72. - Joey - . Buy some hats? (happy) |
|1.  - Joey - Hey, what time is it?  This pokes around midnight right?  God this is great isn't it? (excited) 2. - Joey - . Look at the night we got.  I wouldn't trade this for anything. (excited)  3. - Joey - . Is that, is that, nah, is that just Paul?  I can't even tell. (excited)  4. - Joey - . But if I can't tell, it probably isn't them isn't it?  Probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think?  How are you doing? (excited)  5. - Joey - . Oh, you know what I forgot?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight. (excited)  6. - Fey - . What flashlight? (xxx)  7. - Joey - . You know, the flashlight, the silver one?  There's only one isn't there? (xxx)  8. - Fey - . It's not your flashlight. (xxx)  9. - Joey - . Well, whose is it? (xxx)  10. - Fey - . It's ours.  Mine too. (xxx)  11. - Joey - . No.  Of course, our flashlight.  Yours and mine.  Me flashlight is su flashlight, naturally. (xxx)  12. - Joey - . How could we have not thought to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out. (xxx)  13. - Joey - . Was it a full moon last year when they were running?  I can't remember.  Do you remember? (xxx)  14. - Fey - . Yes. (neutral)  15. - Joey - . Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket? (xxx)  16. - Joey - . We should've brought the blanket, our blanket. (xxx)  17. - Joey - . God.  Oh, you know what would be good right about now?  A six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket. (excited)  18. - Joey - . I'm so stupid, I should've brought a six-pack.  God, I'm like a little kid.  It's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped up. Oh- [LAUGHTER] (excited)  19. - Joey - . I wonder if they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around? (excited)  20. - Fey - . Look, I'm cold. (xxx)  21. - Joey - . Do you want my jacket? (neutral)  22. - Fey - . It's past eleven, let's go. (frustrated)  23. - Joey - . What?  Are you kidding me?  We just got here.  We miss it.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home? (xxx)  24. - Fey - . There is no point in coming down here. (frustrated)  25. - Joey - . Right. (xxx)  26. - Fey - . That's my point. (frustrated)  27. - Joey - . That's my point too...No.  No.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point if we come down here if we just turn around and leave? (frustrated)  28. - Fey - . So let's go. (xxx)  29. - Joey - . Why not? (xxx)  30. - Fey - . I don't know.  I just don't. (xxx)  31. - Joey - . Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  It only happens once a year.  I mean think about the people in Kansas, they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this.  We're only forty minutes away.  This is too good to pass up. (excited)  32. - Fey - . Pass up what?  These fish swim up to shore, on the beach and then they flop around a little, they swim away and then they die. (frustrated)  33. - Joey - . Well this is like the highlight, the one night of their lives and that flopping around, that's laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it. (excited)  34. - Joey - . But this is the big night for these guys.  Their last, life's last orgy. (excited)  35. - Fey - . What are you getting so excited about?  I mean, it's not like it's like the landing on the moon or something.  I mean, it's just fish, fish that nobody eats. (xxx)  36. - Joey - . Yeah they do. (excited)  37. - Fey - . Augie. (frustrated)  38. - Joey - . Okay.  But it's fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows in Capistrano or the Lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs, there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable. (excited)  39. - Joey - . I mean, I can't see how you can not be interested. (xxx)  40. - Fey - . I'm just not. (neutral)  41. - Joey - . For real? (xxx)  42. - Fey - . Yes. (xxx)  43. - Joey - . I don't get it.  I mean the first time we came to see it, you said it was the best night of your life. (xxx)  44. - Joey - . And last year when we came you ran out of the house so fast you stubbed your toe and you didn't even notice it until we got in the car. (xxx)  45. - Fey - . You also could remember that I got sand in my panties, we got in an argument over nothing, you got a sore throat and we didn't even get to see the Grunions. (frustrated)  46. - Joey - . Okay.  We're in a good spot. (xxx)  47. - Fey - . You didn't see them the first time either. (frustrated)  48. - Joey - . We just weren't in the good spot.  This is a much better spot.  You know, I have a good instincts for these things. (frustrated)  49. - Joey - . Look, is that...no is that just seaweed? (excited)  50. - Joey - . You know, this is great isn't it?  You know, I wouldn't trade this for anything. (excited)  51. - Joey - . I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute. (excited)  52. - Joey - . Somewhere out there, there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way, they don't why, we don't know why, they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies... (excited)  53. - Joey - . ...like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming this way.  They didn't, you know, they didn't make a decision, they didn't, you know, have boats or anything.  No one sent them an invitation or a map, they just started swimming as if that's the only thing that matters. (excited)  54. - Joey - . It's single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't, they don't ask it a question, they don't give it a name, they just swim. (excited)  55. - Joey - . They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death. (excited)  56. - Joey - . Oh, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are standing up. (excited)  57. - Fey - . That's the wind. (xxx)  58. - Joey - . [BREATHING] So what do you think? (excited)  59. - Fey - . About what? (xxx)  60. - Joey - . About what I just said? (excited) |
|1.  - Joey - So what do you think? (excited) 2. - Fey - . About what? (anger)  3. - Joey - . About what I just said? (frustrated)  4. - Fey - . It's ridiculous. (anger)  5. - Joey - . It certainly is not.  It's a slightly exaggerated scientific fact. (frustrated)  6. - Fey - . It's PR.  I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach. (anger)  7. - Joey - . I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people. (frustrated)  8. - Fey - . Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now. (anger)  9. - Joey - . Are we talking about the same thing? (frustrated)  10. - Fey - . Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me. (anger)  11. - Joey - . I thought you wanted to see it. (frustrated)  12. - Fey - . It's just... (xxx)  13. - Fey - . Look, we just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to be like. (xxx)  14. - Joey - . There's nothing to it.  The Grunions arrive, they do their little fish business, you know?  We go oh, ahh, look at the fish and they go home and we go home. (frustrated)  15. - Fey - . For heavens sake, grow up.  We're not going to see the Grunions. (frustrated)  16. - Joey - . Why not? (frustrated)  17. - Fey - . We never do, do we?  Have we ever? (frustrated)  18. - Joey - . Oh my gosh.  We missed them twice, that's hardly ever. (frustrated)  19. - Fey - . Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever. (anger)  20. - Joey - . Carla, can I ask you something? (frustrated)  21. - Fey - . What? (xxx)  22. - Joey - . Don't take this wrong but, are you having your period? (frustrated)  23. - Fey - . Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting. (anger)  24. - Joey - . What's bugging you then? (frustrated)  25. - Fey - . Look, it's pointless.  It's...we're not going to see the Grunions I mean, it's like waiting around to see Santa Claus, you know, it's... (frustrated)  26. - Fey - . Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up. (anger)  27. - Joey - . I thought you wanted to see it. (frustrated)  28. - Fey - . God, you don't understand anything. (frustrated)  29. - Joey - . No, of course not. (frustrated)  30. - Fey - . I do.  I always do.  I keep thinking, this time will be the time and it never is. (frustrated)  31. - Joey - . Well, we're going to see it. (neutral)  32. - Fey - . No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie. (anger)  33. - Joey - . What...I've been trying to, I've been trying to figure out the point where we went wrong and I can't seem to pinpoint that moment. (frustrated)  34. - Joey - . You were fine during the phone call with Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem. (xxx)  35. - Fey - . Look, do you remember the first time we came here? (frustrated)  36. - Fey - . We thought I was pregnant. (sad)  37. - Fey - . We brought a bottle of champagne and we took off our shoes and danced barefoot in the sand... (xxx)  38. - Fey - . Under the moon and you whispered so softly into my ear so I could feel your words. (xxx)  39. - Fey - . And I thought, this is it.  This is how happy I'm supposed to be. (xxx)  40. - Joey - . Wait a minute.  I've got it. (neutral)  41. - Fey - . What?  Dancing barefoot in the sand?  Drinking out of a bottle of champagne? (xxx)  42. - Joey - . It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker... (neutral)  43. - Joey - . And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that. (neutral)  44. - Joey - . You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right? (neutral)  45. - Fey - . I'd rather not remember something... (sad)  46. - Fey - . Rather not hope for something. (sad)  47. - Joey - . Okay, right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen, do you want to dance? (xxx)  48. - Fey - . No. (sad)  49. - Joey - . Do you want me to get some champagne? (frustrated)  50. - Fey - . No. (frustrated)  51. - Joey - . Take off our shoes? (frustrated)  52. - Fey - . No. (frustrated)  53. - Joey - . What?  Do you want me to breathe in your ear? (frustrated)  54. - Fey - . No. (frustrated)  55. - Joey - . Do you want to get married again? What? What?  Do you want a divorce? A vacation? What?  A carpet?  A poodle?  A basket of fruit?  What?  A suicide pact?  What the hell do you want Carla? (xxx)  56. - Fey - . No...No...No... (frustrated)  57. - Fey - . No... (frustrated)  58. - Fey - . I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be. (anger)  59. - Joey - . Welcome to the human race. (anger)  60. - Joey - . Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No. (anger)  61. - Joey - . I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids... (anger)  62. - Joey - . ...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this. (anger)  63. - Fey - . This what...what's this?  This isn't anything. Alright.  Sure.  Standing on the beach, fighting and waiting. (frustrated)  64. - Joey - . Yes it is. (anger)  65. - Joey - . Right. (anger)  66. - Fey - . Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be. (anger)  67. - Joey - . No.  I know.  Me neither. (xxx)  68. - Fey - . This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say? (sad)  69. - Joey - . I'm trying to do the best I can. (frustrated)  70. - Fey - . I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice. (sad)  71. - Fey - . I can't help thinking about being somewhere else. (sad)  72. - Joey - . Maybe if you were with someone else too. (sad)  73. - Fey - . I didn't say that. (sad)  74. - Joey - . I know.  But I know I don't make you happy. (sad)  75. - Fey - . Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you. (sad)  76. - Joey - . Yeah? (xxx)  77. - Fey - . Yeah.  Don't you know that? (xxx)  78. - Fey - . If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard. (sad)  79. - Joey - . Actually, now that you mention it, no I don't. (xxx)  80. - Fey - . Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people. (sad)  81. - Joey - . It seemed like a good spot to me. (xxx)  82. - Joey - . I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here. (happy)  83. - Fey - . Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water. (happy)  84. - Fey - . Big old white moon. (xxx)  85. - Joey - . Hey, look what we got here. (happy)  86. - Fey - . Oh you brought refreshments. (happy)  87. - Joey - . It's not champagne. (xxx)  88. - Fey - . Well at least we won't need glasses. (xxx)  89. - Joey - . Are you still cold?  Do you want to go home? (xxx)  90. - Fey - . No I'm beginning to think you might be right. (happy)  91. - Fey - . I think this may be the place for us after all. (happy)  92. - Fey - . I am sorry Augie. (happy)  93. - Joey - . Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come. (happy)  94. - Fey - . Or not. (happy)  95. - Joey - . Or not. (happy) |
|1.  - Joey - Good God. (xxx) 2. - Fey - . Do you think it's them? (xxx)  3. - Joey - . I wonder. (xxx)  4. - Fey - . And nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up. (xxx)  5. - Joey - . Well it must be them then. (xxx)  6. - Fey - . What are you going to do? (xxx)  7. - Joey - . We're fine right?  Aren't we?  Whatever happens darling. (xxx)  8. - Fey - . Now and always sweet. (excited)  9. - Joey - . I don't care then. (excited)  10. - Fey - . I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later. (excited)  11. - Joey - . Hello?  Hello?  What? (xxx)  12. - Fey - . That sent shivers up my spine. (excited)  13. - Joey - . No, wrong number. (excited)  14. - Joey - . What are we to do if they suddenly walk in on us? (xxx)  15. - Fey - . Behave exquisitely. (excited)  16. - Joey - . With the most perfect poise? (xxx)  17. - Fey - . Certainly.  And I shall probably do a court courtesy. (xxx)  18. - Joey - . um- Things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy do they? (xxx)  19. - Fey - . What is so horrible is that one cannot stay happy. (xxx)  20. - Joey - . Oh, darling.  Don't say that. (xxx)  21. - Fey - . It's true.  I mean, the whole business it's a very poor joke. (xxx)  22. - Joey - . You mean that, that sacred and beautiful thing love? (xxx)  23. - Fey - . Yes.  I mean just that. (xxx)  24. - Joey - . What does that all mean?  That's what I asked myself on my quest for ultimate truth.  What does it all mean? (xxx)  25. - Fey - . Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious. (xxx)  26. - Joey - . [LAUGHTER] Oh, darling.  You mustn't be serious, that's just what they want. (xxx)  27. - Fey - . Who's they? (xxx)  28. - Joey - . All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant. (xxx)  29. - Joey - . Laugh at all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings the acid in their damn sweetness and light. (xxx)  30. - Fey - . So if I'm to laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too. (xxx)  31. - Joey - . Oh, certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun alright. (xxx)  32. - Fey - . How long will it last?  This ludicrous overbearing love of ours? (xxx)  33. - Joey - . Who knows? (xxx)  34. - Fey - . Shall we always want to bicker and fight? (xxx)  35. - Joey - . No.  That fire will fade along with our passion. (xxx)  36. - Fey - . Well, dear, shall we want that? (xxx)  37. - Joey - . Well, it depends on how well we've played. (xxx)  38. - Fey - . What happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the other one still laugh? (xxx)  39. - Joey - . Of course, yes, yes, with all his might. (xxx)  40. - Fey - . That's serious enough. (sad)  41. - Joey - . No.  No it isn't.  That's very laughable, a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors. (xxx)  42. - Fey - . Darling I believe you're talking nonsense. (xxx)  43. - Joey - . Oh, and who isn't talking nonsense? (xxx)  44. - Joey - . Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers hmmm?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like quite idiotic school children. (xxx)  45. - Joey - . Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come kiss me darling before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets. (xxx)  46. - Fey - . Elliot, worms don't pop. (xxx)  47. - Joey - . I don't care what you do, you see?  As long, no I don't care what you do, see? (xxx)  48. - Joey - . You can put green paint all over your body and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best. (xxx)  49. - Fey - . Thank you dear.  The same applies to you... (xxx)  50. - Fey - . ...only if you ever so much as look at another woman I'll kill you. (xxx)  51. - Joey - . Remember that awful scene we had in Venice? (xxx)  52. - Fey - . Which particular one? (xxx)  53. - Joey - . The one when you bought a little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed. (xxx)  54. - Fey - . Charles, that was his name, Charles.  Oh, God he was so wiggled so beautifully. (xxx)  55. - Joey - . Horrible little thing. (xxx)  56. - Fey - . Yeah.  I know you did.  You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that. (xxx)  57. - Joey - . I hated it. (xxx)  58. - Joey - . How long did that rile last? (xxx)  59. - Fey - . It went on intermittently for days. (xxx)  60. - Joey - . Oh, the worst one was in Cannes when you- (xxx)  61. - Fey - . I burnt a hole in my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom. (xxx)  62. - Joey - . you're curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown. (xxx)  63. - Joey - . That was a rouser wasn't it? (xxx)  64. - Fey - . [LAUGHTER] Yeah.  That was the first time you ever hit me. (xxx)  65. - Joey - . I didn't hit you very hard. (neutral)  66. - Fey - . The manager came in and saw us rolling on the floor, scratching and biting like panthers. (xxx)  67. - Joey - . I will never forget his face. Ooh-rah [LAUGHTER]. (xxx)  68. - Fey - . How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous. (xxx)  69. - Joey - . We were very much younger then. (xxx)  70. - Fey - . And much sillier too. (xxx)  71. - Joey - . The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.

|1.  - Joey - Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden. (neutral) 2. - Fey - . Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that. (neutral)  3. - Joey - . I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him. (xxx)  4. - Fey - . Presents?  A trivial little broach. (anger)  5. - Joey - . Mmm Hmm.  I remember it well.  Bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste. (xxx)  6. - Fey - . Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often. (xxx)  7. - Joey - . You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. (anger)  8. - Fey - . No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination. (neutral)  9. - Joey - . You must admit he was in love with you. (anger)  10. - Fey - . Just a little perhaps but nothing serious. (neutral)  11. - Joey - . You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it? (anger)  12. - Fey - . Well what of it? (xxx)  13. - Fey - . Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me. (neutral)  14. - Joey - . And what about me? (anger)  15. - Fey - . Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you would've never known anything. (xxx)  16. - Joey - . Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say. (anger)  17. - Fey - . Look, I'm bored with this conversation. (xxx)  18. - Joey - . Yeah, so am I.  Bored stiff. (anger)  19. - Joey - . You want some brandy? (neutral)  20. - Fey - . No thanks. (xxx)  21. - Joey - . I'll have a little I think. (neutral)  22. - Fey - . I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses. (anger)  23. - Joey - . No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones. (anger)  24. - Fey - . I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing. (anger)  25. - Joey - . Oh my...just because I just...okay... (anger)  26. - Joey - . ...having three small minute liquor glasses in the evening is hardly going on and on and on. (xxx)  27. - Fey - . It's become a habit with you. (neutral)  28. - Joey - .

Actually that's perfectly true. (neutral)  39. - Fey - . No it isn't. (xxx)  40. - Joey - . Yes it is. (neutral)  41. - Fey - . Oh, be quiet. (xxx)  42. - Fey - . I think you should have some more brandy... (xxx)  43. - Joey - . I think that (neutral)  44. - Fey - . ...cause really (xxx)  45. - Fey - . it doesn't seem to be working on you. (xxx)  46. - Joey - . perhaps maybe you should've had more brandy, it might've made you a little less disagreeable. (xxx)  47. - Fey - . Well it really hasn't worked wonders with you. (xxx)  48. - Joey - . Hmm, snap, snap, snap like a little adder. (xxx)  49. - Fey - . Adders don't snap, they sting. (anger)  50. - Joey - . Yes they do.

I'm not in the least bit drunk. (anger)  61. - Fey - . You've always had a weak head. (anger)  62. - Joey - . Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk. (anger)  63. - Fey - . On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy. (anger)  64. - Joey - . Oh, what an interesting topic.  What about a child of four and a child of six?  A child of nine? (anger)  65. - Fey - . Shut up. (anger)  66. - Joey - . We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots. (anger)  67. - Fey - . Not very funny dear.  In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy. (anger)  68. - Joey - . Oh, thanks.  I think I will. (anger)  69. - Joey - . You better turn that off. (anger)  70. - Fey - . Why? (xxx)  71. - Joey - . Because people upstairs will get annoyed.

|1.  - Joey - Where?  Did you do it at the front desk or by the baggage claims? (frustrated) 2. - Fey - . I-I don't know.  The place where they told me to go.  Look they told me to come talk to you because you guys lost my bag.  Not it's late.  Not it will be here soon, lost it completely.  What are you going to do about that? (frustrated)  3. - Joey - . Ma'am, first of all I'd like you to calm down.  Second of all- (frustrated)  4. - Fey - . Look that bag has my entire life in it and you just lost it. (frustrated)  5. - Joey - . I understand that ma'am. (xxx)  6. - Fey - . Lost it just, like, I mean, (anger)  7. - Joey - . Ma'am, I understand that. (frustrated)  8. - Fey - . it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention (anger)  9. - Fey - . because my bag was very easy to keep track of.  It's got big, you know, rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it's just gone. (anger)  10. - Joey - . I understand that.  The best I can do for you, at this moment, is give you fifty dollar check courtesy of Northwest Airlines for inconveniencing you in losing your luggage. (frustrated)  11. - Fey - . Wait.  What? (surprise)  12. - Joey - . At this moment in time, all I can do for you is give you- (frustrated)  13. - Fey - . No. No. I heard- I heard what you said. (anger)  14. - Fey - . You're kidding me, right.  You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through.  I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up. (anger)  15. - Joey - . you're getting very excited right now (frustrated)  16. - Fey - . Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it. (anger)  17. - Joey - . I understand that, ma'am but there's not really much I can do for you right now. (frustrated)  18. - Fey - . Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that. (anger)  19. - Joey - . What I need you to do is file another complaint form. There's a form that you can fill out over by the front desk near the baggage claim. (frustrated)  20. - Joey - . If you'd like to take that over to the front desk- Ma'am. (frustrated)  21. - Joey - . We're just talking over each other. (frustrated)  22. - Joey - . We're not going to communicate anything this way. (frustrated)  23. - Fey - . I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it. (anger)  24. - Joey - . Ma'am in flying with Northwest Airlines you agreed to (frustrated)  25. - Joey - . sign away your luggage to the (frustrated)  26. - Fey - . I didn't sign anything. I didn't sign anything. And you people have got to make- (anger)  27. - Joey - . It's part of the small- it's part of the agreement when you're purchasing an airline ticket, there's- when you- (frustrated)  28. - Fey - . You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff.  Fifty dollars is unacceptable. (anger)  29. - Joey - . Ma'am, please calm down.  When you purchase a ticket, there is a terms and agreement, (frustrated)  30. - Fey - . No.  No.  I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what?  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option. (anger)  31. - Joey - . terms and conditions- in the agreement of purchasing a ticket. Most people frequently look it over (frustrated)  32. - Joey - . The best that we can do for you is give you- (frustrated)  33. - Joey - . Ma'am. (frustrated)  34. - Fey - . I want to talk to your supervisor. (anger)  35. - Joey - . I am- I am- I am my own supervisor. (frustrated)  36. - Fey - . I've had enough.  I want to talk to-no, no unacceptable I want to your supervisor. I am done with this. (anger)  37. - Joey - . I am the supervisor, ma'am. (frustrated)  38. - Fey - . Really, you don't work for anybody.  It's just you? (anger)  39. - Joey - . I am the current manager on duty. (frustrated)  40. - Fey - . Okay.  Well I want to call whoever you report to, whoever your boss is because I have had enough with this airline and I am finished waiting for my fifty dollar gift certificate. (anger)  41. - Joey - . Ma'am, I own Northwest Airlines. (frustrated) |

|1.  - Fey - What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it. (xxx) 2. - Joey - . He saw it. (neutral)  3. - Fey - . When? (xxx)  4. - Joey - . About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked. (xxx)  5. - Fey - . Did you talk to him? (sad)  6. - Joey - . No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone. (sad)  7. - Fey - . What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night. (frustrated)  8. - Joey - . I guess he is. (xxx)  9. - Joey - . I don't know the meaning of this, mom.  But I know one thing you made a terrible mistake with dad. (frustrated)  10. - Fey - . What? (surprise)  11. - Joey - . Being dishonest with him, that kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off. (frustrated)  12. - Fey - . What do you mean dishonest? (xxx)  13. - Joey - . You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him? (anger)  14. - Fey - . What do you want to do, argue with him? (anger)  15. - Joey - . I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore. (anger)  16. - Joey - . Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now? (xxx)  17. - Fey - . You can't say that to him. (anger)  18. - Joey - . We've got to say it to him. (anger)  19. - Fey - . How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it? (anger)  20. - Joey - . For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane. (anger)  21. - Fey - . To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you? (anger)  22. - Joey - . Sit down mom.  I want to talk to you. (frustrated)  23. - Fey - . The trouble is the goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry. (anger)  24. - Joey - . Alright, alright, alright.  Listen. You know why I asked Annie here don't you? (frustrated)  25. - Fey - . Why? (xxx)  26. - Joey - . You know why. (neutral)  27. - Fey - . Well I got an idea but what's the story? (xxx)  28. - Joey - . I'm going to ask her to marry me. (neutral)  29. - Fey - . Well that's only your business, Chris. (neutral)  30. - Joey - . You know it's not only my business. (frustrated)  31. - Fey - . What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind. (anger)  32. - Joey - . Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it. (frustrated)  33. - Fey - . Well you want to make sure that father isn't going to- (xxx)  34. - Joey - . Then it isn't just my business. (anger)  35. - Fey - . I'm just saying. (frustrated)  36. - Joey - . Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it. (anger)  37. - Joey - . Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things. (anger)  38. - Fey - . I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl. (anger)  39. - Joey - . She's not Larry's girl. (frustrated)  40. - Fey - . From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl. (anger)  41. - Fey - . Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you? (anger)  42. - Joey - . I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life time after time after time. (frustrated)  43. - Fey - . You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that. (neutral)  44. - Joey - . To hell with that. (anger)  45. - Fey - . Did you ask Annie yet? (xxx)  46. - Joey - . I wanted to get this settled first. (sad)  47. - Fey - . How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does. (frustrated)  48. - Joey - . Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out. (frustrated)  49. - Joey - . and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me. (anger)  50. - Fey - . The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did. (frustrated)  51. - Joey - . So what I'm not fast with women. (anger)  52. - Fey - . I don't see why it has to be Annie. (anger)  53. - Joey - . Because it is. (anger)  54. - Fey - . Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years. (anger)  55. - Joey - . I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her. (xxx)  56. - Joey - . These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram? (sad)  57. - Fey - . I don't want a diagram.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris. (frustrated)  58. - Fey - . You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't? (anger)  59. - Joey - . Alright then mom. (xxx)  60. - Fey - . Just give it some more thought. (xxx)  61. - Joey - . I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry (anger)  62. - Joey - . and everything would be happy and we would have a regular wedding.  But if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out. (frustrated)  63. - Fey - . What the hell is this? (xxx)  64. - Joey - . I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else, maybe New York. (xxx)  65. - Fey - . Are you crazy? (anger)  66. - Joey - . I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker I'm through with it. (xxx)  67. - Fey - . You've got a business here.  What the hell is this? (anger)  68. - Joey - . The business, the business doesn't inspire me. (anger)  69. - Fey - . Must you be inspired? (anger)  70. - Joey - . Yes, I like it an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening I want it beautiful. (frustrated)  71. - Joey - . I want- I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I give myself to.  Annie is in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it? (frustrated)  72. - Fey - . You mean-tell me something you mean you'd really leave the business? (frustrated)  73. - Joey - . Yes on this I would. (xxx)  74. - Fey - . Well you don't want to think that way. (xxx)  75. - Joey - . Then you help me stay here. (frustrated)  76. - Fey - . Alright but don't think that way (anger)  77. - Fey - . because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris. (anger)  78. - Joey - . I know.  Just you help me stay here. (frustrated)  79. - Fey - . But don't think that way.  You hear me? (anger)  80. - Joey - . I am thinking that way. (xxx)  81. - Fey - . I don't understand you do I? (xxx)  82. - Joey - . No.  I'm a pretty tough guy. (xxx)  83. - Fey - . Yeah.  I can see that.

Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited. (anger)  14. - Joey - . How do you know why she waited? (frustrated)  15. - Fey - . Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock. (anger)  16. - Fey - . In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right. (frustrated)  17. - Joey - . Look it's a nice day.

Laugh, laugh at me, but why did that happen the very night she came back? (xxx)  24. - Fey - . She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look, look at it.

Oh, I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around? (xxx)  19. - Fey - . I'm cold. (xxx)  20. - Joey - . Do you want my jacket? (xxx)  21. - Fey - . It's after eleven let's go home. (anger)  22. - Joey - . Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home? (frustrated)  23. - Fey - . There is no point in coming down here. (anger)  24. - Joey - . Right. (frustrated)  25. - Fey - . That's my point. (frustrated)  26. - Joey - . That's my point too. (neutral)  27. - Fey - . So let's go home. (frustrated)  28. - Joey - . No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it? (frustrated)  29. - Fey - . Not particularly. (frustrated)  30. - Joey - . Why not? (xxx)  31. - Fey - . I just don't.  It's stupid. (anger)  32. - Joey - . Honey this is natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year.  This is a great opportunity. (frustrated)  33. - Joey - . Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up. (excited)  34. - Fey - . Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die. (anger)  35. - Joey - . Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that. (frustrated)  36. - Joey - . This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. (excited)  37. - Fey - . What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats. (anger)  38. - Joey - . Yeah, they do. (frustrated)  39. - Fey - . Oh, Augie. (frustrated)  40. - Joey - . Okay but it's fish who do something none of the other fish do (frustrated)  41. - Joey - . like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic (excited)  42. - Joey - . a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you cannot be interested. (frustrated)  43. - Fey - . I'm just not. (anger)  44. - Joey - . For real? (surprise)  45. - Fey - . Yes. (anger)  46. - Joey - . I don't get it.  The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car. (frustrated)  47. - Fey - . Last year you will also remember our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got in a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the Grunions. (xxx)  48. - Joey - . We weren't in a good spot. (frustrated)  49. - Fey - . We didn't see them the first time either. (anger)  50. - Joey - . We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot. (anger)  51. - Joey - . I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there. What's that.  Is that?  Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it. (excited)  52. - Joey - . Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute. (excited)  53. - Joey - . Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote. (excited)  54. - Joey - . No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming. (excited)  55. - Joey - . They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters. (excited)  56. - Joey - . It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge. (excited)  57. - Joey - . They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place (excited)  58. - Joey - . where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death. (excited)  59. - Joey - . Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up. (excited)  60. - Fey - . That's the wind. (frustrated)  61. - Joey - . Well so what do you think? (xxx)  62. - Fey - . About what? (anger)  63. - Joey - . What I said. (xxx)  64. - Fey - . It's ridiculous. (anger) |
|1.  - Joey - Well, so what do you think? (neutral) 2. - Fey - . About what? (xxx)  3. - Joey - . What I said. (xxx)  4. - Fey - . It's ridiculous. (xxx)  5. - Joey - . It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact. (xxx)  6. - Fey - . It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach. (anger)  7. - Joey - . I'm not the only one.  Look at these people. (xxx)  8. - Fey - . Well sure everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us all excited, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action. (xxx)  9. - Joey - . Are we talking about the same thing? (xxx)  10. - Fey - . Well I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me. (xxx)  11. - Joey - . Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way but are you having your period? (xxx)  12. - Fey - . Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting. (anger)  13. - Joey - . Well then what's bugging you? (frustrated)  14. - Fey - . We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like. (anger)  15. - Joey - . There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home. (frustrated)  16. - Fey - . For heaven's sake, this is not about fish. (anger)  17. - Joey - . Why not? (frustrated)  18. - Fey - . We totally skipped. Right. (neutral)  19. - Joey - . There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do the little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home. (xxx)  20. - Fey - . For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions. (anger)  21. - Joey - . Why not? (frustrated)  22. - Fey - . We never do.  Do we have we ever? (anger)  23. - Joey - . We've missed them twice that's not ever. (frustrated)  24. - Fey - . Twice is every time we've tried that's ever. (anger)  25. - Joey - . We'll see them this year. (frustrated)  26. - Fey - . No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Clause. (xxx)  27. - Fey - . God I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up, (xxx)  28. - Fey - . and the fish won't show up. (anger)  29. - Joey - . I thought you wanted to see it. (frustrated)  30. - Fey - . You don't understand anything I'm saying. (frustrated)  31. - Joey - . No, of course not. (frustrated)  32. - Fey - . I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is. (frustrated)  33. - Joey - . It's just a fish.  Nothing to get traumatized over. (frustrated)  34. - Fey - . For heaven's sake, this is not about fish. (xxx)  35. - Joey - . I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.  You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem. (frustrated)  36. - Joey - . Let's see I took a shower.  You watched the news.  You said the Grunions are running tonight. I said great let's go.  I feel lucky tonight. (xxx)  37. - Joey - . Okay.  Uh, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals.  We're getting the car out of the garage. (xxx)  38. - Fey - . Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married. (xxx)  39. - Fey - . We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes (sad)  40. - Fey - . and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me (sad)  41. - Fey - . right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them. (sad)  42. - Fey - . And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be. (sad)  43. - Joey - . Wait a minute.  I've got it. (neutral)  44. - Fey - . Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle. (sad)  45. - Joey - . It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right? (neutral)  46. - Joey - . That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it. (excited)  47. - Fey - . I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things. (sad)  48. - Joey - . Okay.  Right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen you want to dance? (xxx)  49. - Fey - . No. (neutral)  50. - Joey - . You want me to get some champagne? (neutral)  51. - Fey - . No. (sad)  52. - Joey - . Take off our shoes? (xxx)  53. - Fey - . No.  No. (frustrated)  54. - Joey - . Well what?  Want me to breath in your ear? (frustrated)  55. - Fey - . No. (frustrated)  56. - Joey - . Want to get married again? (frustrated)  57. - Fey - . No. (frustrated)  58. - Joey - . What?  What do you want a divorce? (frustrated)  59. - Fey - . No. (frustrated)  60. - Joey - . A vacation? (frustrated)  61. - Fey - . No. (anger)  62. - Joey - . A new carpet, a poodle, a backrub, ice cream, a suicide pact.  What?  What?  Carla what the hell do you want? (frustrated)  63. - Fey - . I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to. (xxx)  64. - Joey - . Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind. (xxx)  65. - Joey - . Do you think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish. (frustrated)  66. - Joey - . Do you think that I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex and times I would look at you and think holy hell when's the next flight to Alaska. (frustrated)  67. - Joey - . No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our (frustrated)  68. - Joey - . Sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha, ha baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get, (frustrated)  69. - Joey - . you know what you get Carla, this. (xxx)  70. - Fey - . This what, what is this?  This isn't even anything. (anger)  71. - Joey - . Yes it is. (xxx)  72. - Fey - . Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting. (anger)  73. - Joey - . Right. (xxx)  74. - Fey - . But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like. (xxx)  75. - Joey - . No, I know me either. (xxx)  76. - Fey - . This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot in everything but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say? (xxx)  77. - Joey - . I'm doing the best I can. (frustrated)  78. - Fey - . I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else. (sad)  79. - Joey - . Maybe if you were with somebody else too. (sad)  80. - Fey - . I didn't say that. (frustrated)  81. - Joey - . No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy. (sad)  82. - Fey - . For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you. (frustrated)  83. - Joey - . Yeah? (surprise)  84. - Fey - . Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else (frustrated)  85. - Fey - . somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard. (sad)  86. - Joey - . Actually now that you mention it, no I don't. (neutral)  87. - Fey - . Okay.  Fine.  So we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person. (xxx)  88. - Joey - . I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me. (neutral)  89. - Joey - . I mean look at the view you've got of the moon from here. (xxx)  90. - Fey - . Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon. (happy)  91. - Joey - . Well look at what we got here. (excited)  92. - Fey - . Oh, Augie you brought refreshments. (happy)  93. - Joey - . It's not champagne. (neutral)  94. - Fey - . Well then I guess we don't need glasses. (happy)  95. - Joey - . You still cold?  Do you want to go home? (xxx)  96. - Fey - . I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this may be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry. (happy)  97. - Joey - . Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come. (xxx)  98. - Fey - . Or not. (xxx)  99. - Joey - . Or not. (xxx) |
|1.  - Joey - I wonder. (fear) 2. - Fey - . Nobody knows we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up. (xxx)  3. - Joey - . It must be them then. (fear)  4. - Fey - . Well what are we going to do? (xxx)  5. - Joey - . We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we? (xxx)  6. - Fey - . Now and always sweet. (xxx)  7. - Joey - . I don't care then. (xxx)  8. - Fey - . It was bound to come sooner or later. (xxx)  9. - Joey - . Hello.  Hello.  What?  Wrong number. (xxx)  10. - Fey - . Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine. (excited)  11. - Joey - . What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us? (excited)  12. - Fey - . Behave exquisitely. (excited)  13. - Joey - . With the most perfect poise. (excited)  14. - Fey - . Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy. (excited)  15. - Joey - . Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they? (excited)  16. - Fey - . What is so horrible is that one can't stay happy. (xxx)  17. - Joey - . Don't say that, my darling. (neutral)  18. - Fey - . It's true the whole business is very poor joke. (excited)  19. - Joey - . Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love. (xxx)  20. - Fey - . Yes, meaning just that. (xxx)  21. - Joey - . What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God what does it all mean? (xxx)  22. - Fey - . Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious. (excited)  23. - Joey - . You mustn't be serious, my darling.  It's just what they want. (xxx)  24. - Fey - . Who's they? (neutral)  25. - Joey - . All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable. (xxx)  26. - Joey - . Laugh at them, be flippant, laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths (xxx)  27. - Joey - . flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light. (xxx)  28. - Fey - . If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too. (xxx)  29. - Joey - . Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun alright. (xxx)  30. - Fey - . Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours? (excited)  31. - Joey - . Well who knows? (neutral)  32. - Fey - . We always want to bicker and fight. (xxx)  33. - Joey - . No that fire will fade long with our passion. (xxx)  34. - Fey - . Oh, dear shall we like that? (xxx)  35. - Joey - . It all depends on how well we've played. (xxx)  36. - Fey - . What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left still laugh? (neutral)  37. - Joey - . Yes.  Yes.  with all his might. (xxx)  38. - Fey - . Well that's serious enough, isn't it? (xxx)  39. - Joey - . No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors. (xxx)  40. - Fey - . Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense. (xxx)  41. - Joey - . So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers. (xxx)  42. - Joey - . Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can like small quite idiotic little school children. (xxx)  43. - Joey - . Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets. (xxx)  44. - Fey - . Elliott, worms don't pop. (xxx)  45. - Joey - . I don't mind what you do, see. you can paint yourself green all over (xxx)  46. - Joey - . and dance naked in the place Place Vendome and rush away with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best. (xxx)  47. - Fey - . Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you. (excited)  48. - Joey - . Do you remember that awful scene in Venice? (neutral)  49. - Fey - . Which particular one? (excited)  50. - Joey - . The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed. (neutral)  51. - Fey - . Oh, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles he did wriggle so beautifully. (excited)  52. - Joey - . Horrible thing.  I hated it. (neutral)  53. - Fey - . Yes, I know you did.  You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that. (excited)  54. - Joey - . How long did that row last? (neutral)  55. - Fey - . It went on intermittently for days. (xxx)  56. - Joey - . The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown. (neutral)  57. - Fey - . It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom. (excited)  58. - Joey - . Ah, we were much younger then.  That was a rouser wasn't it? (xxx)  59. - Fey - . That was the first time you ever hit me. (xxx)  60. - Joey - . You didn't hit me- I didn't hit you very hard. (xxx)  61. - Fey - . Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers. (excited)  62. - Joey - . I shall never forget his face. (xxx)  63. - Fey - . How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous. (excited)  64. - Joey - . We were very much younger then. (xxx)  65. - Fey - . And very much sillier. (excited)  66. - Joey - . As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. (xxx) |
|1.  - Joey - As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. (neutral) 2. - Fey - . There was nothing in that, you know that. (xxx)  3. - Joey - . I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him. (anger)  4. - Fey - . Presents a trivial little broach. (xxx)  5. - Joey - . I remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste. (xxx)  6. - Fey - . Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often. (xxx)  7. - Joey - . You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. (anger)  8. - Fey - . I did not.  You made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination. (xxx)  9. - Joey - . You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he? (xxx)  10. - Fey - . Just a little perhaps, nothing serious. (xxx)  11. - Joey - . You let him kiss you.  You said you did. (anger)  12. - Fey - . What of it? (anger)  13. - Joey - . What of it? (anger)  14. - Fey - . It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me. (xxx)  15. - Joey - . What about me? (anger)  16. - Fey - . If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it. (xxx)  17. - Joey - . That's a nice point of view, I must say. (anger)  18. - Fey - . Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation. (frustrated)  19. - Joey - . So am I.  Bored stiff.  Want some brandy? (xxx)  20. - Fey - . No thanks. (frustrated)  21. - Joey - . I'll have some myself, I think. (neutral)  22. - Fey - . I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses. (xxx)  23. - Joey - . No particular reason.  Anyway they were very small ones. (xxx)  24. - Fey - . seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing. (xxx)  25. - Joey - . You can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on. (frustrated)  26. - Fey - . It's become a habit with you. (anger)  27. - Joey - . You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment. (xxx)  28. - Fey - . Oh, don't be so stupid. (anger)  29. - Joey - . Really, Amanda. (anger)  30. - Fey - . What? (anger)  31. - Joey - . Nothing. (anger)  32. - Joey - . Going somewhere, my dear? (anger)  33. - Fey - . Just making myself fascinating for you. (frustrated)  34. - Joey - . Ah, that reply has broken my heart. (xxx)  35. - Fey - . The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute will you. (frustrated)  36. - Joey - . As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true. (xxx)  37. - Fey - . Oh, no it isn't (frustrated)  38. - Joey - . Yes, it is. (xxx)  39. - Fey - . Oh, be quiet. (xxx)  40. - Joey - . It's a pity you don't have anymore brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable. (xxx)  41. - Fey - . It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you. (anger)  42. - Joey - . Snap, snap, snap like a little adder. (frustrated)  43. - Fey - . Adders don't snap they sting. (anger)  44. - Joey - . Non-sense they have bags of venom behind their fangs and they snap. (xxx)  45. - Fey - . They sting. (anger)  46. - Joey - . They snap. (xxx)  47. - Fey - . I don't care, okay.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops. (anger)  48. - Joey - . Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce? (neutral)  49. - Fey - . Yes, I did quite a lot. (anger)  50. - Joey - . I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then. (xxx)  51. - Fey - . Mind your own business. (anger)  52. - Joey - . You must have had a riotous time.  No restraint at all, very enjoyable, you never had much anyhow. (xxx)  53. - Fey - . You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk. (anger)  54. - Joey - . I'm not in the least drunk. (anger)  55. - Fey - . You always had a weak head. (anger)  56. - Joey - . I think I mentioned once before that I had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that. (frustrated)  57. - Fey - . On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy. (anger)  58. - Joey - . Very interesting and how about a child of six and a child of four and a child of nine. (xxx)  59. - Fey - . Oh, shut up. (anger)  60. - Joey - . They'd get up a splendid little debate about that, you know.  Intemperate tots. (xxx)  61. - Fey - . Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy. (anger)  62. - Joey - . Very good idea.  I will. (anger)  63. - Joey - . You'd better turn that off I think. (xxx)  64. - Fey - . Why? (anger)  65. - Joey - . It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs. (xxx)  66. - Fey - . There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio. (anger)  67. - Joey - . There are people downstairs I suppose.

You don't understand because it was my luggage that was lost.  Okay. (frustrated)  31. - Joey - . Yeah.  If it was yours, but it's not. It's mine.  Okay. So just-- (anger)  32. - Fey - . But it's not.  It's yours.  I understand. (neutral)  33. - Fey - . I know.  We want to work with you.  We will give you the fifty dollars but I'm-- (frustrated)  34. - Joey - . No, it's not going to be -- but it's not going to be fifty, it's going to be a hundred and fifty.  You're going to write three, you understand, three of- of the forms.  You're going to write three of them out and then give it to me. (xxx)  35. - Fey - . Yeah, we don't do that.  I can go ahead and send you-- (frustrated)  36. - Joey - . You- you- you- you're misunderstanding me.  You're going to do that. (frustrated)  37. - Fey - . We will definitely keep an eye out for your bag. We will try to find it.  We will, you know, fill out the form for missing items. (frustrated)  38. - Joey - . Look, can I just -- can I speak to your manager, please?  'Cause I- I really -- I don't, um -- I mean, I just don't want to deal with -- I know that -- I mean, I know this isn't your fault, (frustrated)  39. - Fey - . No one can make the three check thing happen 'cause we don't do that. (frustrated)  40. - Fey - . I can write you the one check. (frustrated)  41. - Joey - . but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen. (anger)  42. - Fey - . All- all that my supervisor could do is the exact same thing that I'm offering to do. (frustrated)  43. - Joey - . But what I'm talk -- but I'm just,just- please let me-- (frustrated)  44. - Joey - . But if I could just speak directly -- if I could just speak directly to your-- to your superior person (frustrated)  45. - Fey - . I'd be happy to give you a cup of coffee, too. (frustrated)  46. - Fey - . We'll just throw that in--gratuitously. (frustrated)  47. - Joey - . then that would be helpful to me because I just feel like if- you don't think you have the power to write three checks but you actually do. see? (frustrated)  48. - Fey - . No, I don't. See, I could lose my job if I did that. (frustrated)  49. - Joey - . But your job is not my concern. My concern is getting my luggage. (frustrated)  50. - Fey - . And your bag is not my concern. (frustrated)  51. - Fey - . The fifty dollars I'm going to give you for your bag is really all I'm concerned with. (frustrated)  52. - Joey - . Look, I don't -- look, can we just not argue about this.  Like-- (frustrated)  53. - Fey - . I'm more than happy to not argue about it.  I will give you your fifty dollar certificate. (frustrated)  54. - Fey - . You can go ahead and go fill out the form. We'll look for your bag. (frustrated)  55. - Joey - . So what if- what if we- what if we do three forms (frustrated)  56. - Joey - . with different names on them? That- (frustrated)  57. - Fey - . Then that would be lying. (frustrated)  58. - Joey - . but, no. See, 'cause (frustrated)  59. - Joey - . if we have three forms then I can get the hundred and fifty. (frustrated)  60. - Fey - . I'm sorry.  We can only issue one fifty dollar certificate to cover the lost bag for one person. (frustrated)  61. - Joey - . Just please, will you please just work with me here? Just -- all I'm asking you to do is just work with me. I know -- I know that you get lots of people all day long who give you shit, give you crap, but (frustrated)  62. - Fey - . I understand you're frustrated, but-- (neutral)  63. - Joey - . um, you know, I -- this is my bag and I need the hundred and fifty dollars. Please. (frustrated)  64. - Fey - . I know. I understand it's personal-- It's personal to you. I get that. (neutral)  65. - Joey - . Please. (anger)  66. - Fey - . But if you want to just sit down, you know, maybe have a cup of tea, calm down a little bit, we'll go ahead and we'll do what we can for you. you okey (frustrated)  67. - Joey - . I'm already calm. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm. (anger)  68. - Joey - . Just all I need you to do is just fill out three forms and I'll leave you alone forever, forever.  I'll never -- we'll never see each other again. (frustrated)  69. - Fey - . And I'm looking forward to that.  However, I can't do that. I would lose my job. (frustrated)  70. - Joey - . But that's not going to-- But you don't understand. You're looking forward to never seeing me again. (frustrated)  71. - Fey - . Oh, yes. (frustrated)  72. - Joey - . But never seeing me again is not going to happen until you give me the three checks. (frustrated)  73. - Fey - . I'm sorry, really.  But-- (frustrated)  74. - Joey - . I don't -- I'm not- I'm not convinced. (frustrated)  75. - Fey - . That I'm sorry? (frustrated)  76. - Joey - . Yeah.  If you were really sorry, you'd give me the three checks. (anger)  77. - Joey - . So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm? (anger) |
|1.  - Fey - Hey, how you doing? (sad) 2. - Fey - . I know- I know there's nothing I can say that will really help, but-- (sad)  3. - Joey - . I know.  I just -- I don't know.  It's just weird because you have somebody who's, you know, (sad)  4. - Joey - . a major part of your life and then they're gone.  And I don't know.  That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before. (sad)  5. - Fey - . But, I'm here if there's anything you need.  I mean, you just have to ask.  I know -- (sad)  6. - Joey - . Thanks.

[BREATHING] I mean, there's nothing really to talk about.  He's gone and I'll never see him again. (sad)  13. - Fey - . Well I know it's not a lot of help or anything, but at least you got to know him.  I mean, at least you had the time with him that you did. (sad)  14. - Joey - . Yeah. (sad)  15. - Fey - . I mean, we can be grateful for that. (sad)  16. - Joey - . Yeah, I don't know.  Sometimes I wish I didn't know him.  So I wouldn't-- (sad)  17. - Joey - . This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand. (sad)  18. - Fey - . Just life, in general? (xxx)  19. - Joey - . I mean, it's just not fair.  Like, I don't know.  Why people - (sad)  20. - Joey - . there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected. (sad)  21. - Fey - . I agree.  If I knew how to make that happen, I would certainly help you. (sad)  22. - Joey - . I don't know what to do. (sad)  23. - Fey - . When's the service? Can- can we help?  Is there anything, I mean-- (sad)  24. - Joey - . I mean, you- you can go.  I don't know.  I don't know what else. (sad)  25. - Joey - . I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable. (sad)  26. - Fey - . Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be. (sad)  27. - Joey - . Yeah. (sad)  28. - Joey - . I just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically. (sad)  29. - Fey - . I know. (sad)  30. - Joey - . Just, you know, some thing; some genie. I need to find a genie bottle. (sad)  31. - Fey - . I don't have any magic answers.  But, (sad)  32. - Fey - . I mean, as- as cliche as it is, as long as people who loved him remember him, then it's not a waste, you know. (sad)  33. - Joey - . I know. (sad) |

What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night. (xxx)  10. - Joey - . I don't know the meaning of it, mom.  But I know one thing; we made a terrible mistake with dad. (frustrated)  11. - Fey - . What? (surprise)  12. - Joey - . Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off. (xxx)  13. - Fey - . What do you mean, dishonest? (frustrated)  14. - Joey - . You know that Larry's not coming back.  And I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him? (xxx)  15. - Fey - . What do you want to do?  Argue with him? (frustrated)  16. - Joey - . I don't want to argue with him but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore. (frustrated)  17. - Fey - . You can't say that to him. (anger)  18. - Joey - . We've gotta say it to him. (anger)  19. - Fey - . How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it? (anger)  20. - Joey - . For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane. (anger)  21. - Fey - . To you it is and to me, but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body and no grave, so where are you? (anger)  22. - Joey - . Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you. (xxx)  23. - Fey - . The trouble is the Goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere, so the next boy is going to be Larry.

(frustrated)  34. - Joey - . Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things. (anger)  35. - Fey - . I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl. (anger)  36. - Joey - . She's not Larry's girl. (frustrated)  37. - Fey - . Now what can I do for you? (frustrated)  38. - Joey - . I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time after time.

(xxx)  42. - Joey - . I wanted to get this settled first. (neutral)  43. - Fey - . How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does. (neutral)  44. - Joey - . Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  We'll find out.  Then we'll thrash it out with dad. Right, mom?  Don't avoid me. (xxx)  45. - Fey - . The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did. (neutral)  46. - Joey - . So what?  I'm not fast with women. (xxx)  47. - Fey - . I don't see why it has to be Annie. (anger)  48. - Joey - . Because it is. (frustrated)  49. - Fey - . Well that's a good answer, but it don't answer anything.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know?  Because I don't. (xxx)  50. - Joey - . Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom. (neutral)  51. - Fey - . Yes we did. Do you want to keep going? (neutral)  52. - Joey - . Yeah, let's keep going. (neutral)  53. - Fey - . Just give it some more thought. (neutral)  54. - Joey - . I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that if (frustrated)  55. - Joey - . father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out. (sad)  56. - Fey - . What the hell is this? (anger)  57. - Joey - . I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else.  Maybe New York. (xxx)  58. - Fey - . Are you crazy? (anger)  59. - Joey - . I've been a good son too long; a good sucker.  I'm through with it. (frustrated)  60. - Fey - . You've got a business here.  What the hell is this? (anger)  61. - Joey - . The business?  The business doesn't inspire me. (anger)  62. - Fey - . Must you be inspired? (anger)  63. - Joey - . Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful. (anger)  64. - Joey - . I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it? (xxx)  65. - Fey - . You mean -- tell me something.  You mean you'd really leave the business? (xxx)  66. - Joey - . Yes, on this I would. (neutral)  67. - Fey - . You don't want to think like that. (anger)  68. - Joey - . Then you help me stay here. (neutral)  69. - Fey - . Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you. (anger)  70. - Joey - . I know that.  Just you help me stay here. (frustrated)  71. - Fey - . But don't think that way, you hear me? (anger)  72. - Joey - . I am thinking that way. (xxx)  73. - Fey - . I don't understand you, do I? (xxx)  74. - Joey - . No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy. (frustrated)  75. - Fey - . Yeah, I can see that. (xxx) |
|1.  - Fey - Why did he invite her here? (anger) 2. - Joey - . Why does- why, does that bother you? (xxx)  3. - Fey - . She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden-- (anger)  4. - Joey - . Well, maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her. (xxx)  5. - Joey - . Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you. (xxx)  6. - Fey - . He's not going to marry her. (anger)  7. - Joey - . How do you know he's even thinking about it? (neutral)  8. - Fey - . It's got that about it. (anger)  9. - Joey - . Well so what? (neutral)  10. - Fey - . Now listen, kid. Now, listen. (neutral)  11. - Joey - . Oh.  Now listen, kid. (xxx)  12. - Fey - . She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not. (anger)  13. - Joey - . You can't read her mind. (xxx)  14. - Fey - . Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited. (anger)  15. - Joey - . How do you know why she waited? (xxx)  16. - Fey - . Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right. (anger)  17. - Joey - . What do you want me to do? What do you want? (frustrated)  18. - Fey - . I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense. (anger)  19. - Joey - . But, Kate-- (frustrated)  20. - Fey - . Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. (anger)  21. - Fey - . Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here? (anger)  22. - Fey - . She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe-- (anger)  23. - Joey - . Calm yourself. (frustrated)  24. - Fey - . Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone (anger)  25. - Joey - . Calm yourself. (frustrated)  26. - Fey - . You, above all, have got to believe.  You. (anger)  27. - Joey - . Why me above all? (frustrated)  28. - Fey - . Just don't stop believing. (xxx)  29. - Joey - . What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking. (xxx)  30. - Fey - . I can't help it. (sad)  31. - Joey - . What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate? (anger) |
|1.  - Fey - You're the only one I know who loves his parents. (xxx) 2. - Joey - . So you're not sorry you came? (xxx)  3. - Fey - . No, not sorry, but I'm not going to stay. (xxx)  4. - Joey - . Why? (xxx)  5. - Joey - . What? (xxx)  6. - Fey - . I knew they would, your mother, anyway. (xxx)  7. - Joey - . How did you know? (xxx)  8. - Joey - . I guess you know this is why I asked you to come. (xxx)  9. - Fey - . I guess this is why I came. (xxx)  10. - Joey - . Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you. (xxx)  11. - Joey - . I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.  I'm embarrassing you. (xxx)  12. - Joey - . I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted someplace we'd never been; someplace where we'd be brand new to each other. (xxx)  13. - Joey - . You think this is wrong, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to win you away from anything. (xxx)  14. - Fey - . Chris, I've been ready a long, long time. (xxx)  15. - Joey - . Why didn't you? (xxx)  16. - Fey - . You started to write me. (xxx)  17. - Joey - . You felt something that far back? (xxx)  18. - Fey - . Every day since. (happy)  19. - Joey - . Anne, give me a kiss.  Give me a - (xxx)  20. - Joey - . I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've waited to kiss you. (xxx)  21. - Fey - . I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you. (happy)  22. - Joey - . I kissed you. (xxx)  23. - Fey - . Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it, Chris? (xxx)  24. - Joey - . Let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you. (xxx)  25. - Fey - . No, what is it, Chris?  Your mother? (xxx)  26. - Joey - . No, no, nothing like that. (xxx)  27. - Fey - . Then what's wrong.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed. (xxx)  28. - Joey - . Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me. (sad)  29. - Fey - . You've got to tell me. (xxx)  30. - Joey - . I don't know where to start. (sad)  31. - Fey - . It wouldn't work this way. (xxx)  32. - Joey - . It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company? (sad)  33. - Fey - . How many? (sad)  34. - Joey - . It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men. (sad)  35. - Joey - . For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. (sad)  36. - Joey - . They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today. (xxx)  37. - Joey - . And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made, (sad)  38. - Joey - . a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible. (sad)  39. - Joey - . There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow (sad)  40. - Joey - . because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive; (sad)  41. - Joey - . to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man. (sad)  42. - Joey - . You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you. (sad)  43. - Fey - . And do you still feel that way? (xxx)  44. - Fey - . And your money, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that. (xxx)  45. - Joey - . Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune. (happy)  46. - Fey - . What'll I do with a fortune? (happy) |
|1.  - Joey - What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here; couldn't be better. (xxx) 2. - Joey - . Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think? (excited)  3. - Joey - . How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight. (excited)  4. - Fey - . What flashlight? (xxx)  5. - Joey - . Whose is it? (neutral)  6. - Fey - . It's ours.  It's mine, too. (anger)  7. - Joey - . Well, sure. (frustrated)  8. - Fey - . You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel? (anger)  9. - Joey - . No, of course, our flashlight; yours and mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight, naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out. (xxx)  10. - Joey - . Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket. (neutral)  11. - Joey - . Oh, man.  This is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Six pack would be just the ticket right about now.  I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.  Oh. (xxx)  12. - Joey - . I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around. (xxx)  13. - Fey - . It's after eleven; let's go home. (anger)  14. - Joey - . Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home? (frustrated)  15. - Fey - . That's my point. (frustrated)  16. - Joey - . That's my point, too. (neutral)  17. - Fey - . So let's go home. (anger)  18. - Joey - . No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it? (frustrated)  19. - Fey - . Not particularly. (frustrated)  20. - Joey - . Why not? (xxx)  21. - Fey - . I just don't.  It's stupid. (anger)  22. - Joey - . Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up. (excited)  23. - Fey - . Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die. (anger)  24. - Fey - . What are you so excited about? (neutral)  25. - Joey - . Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy. (excited)  26. - Fey - . This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats. (frustrated)  27. - Joey - . Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that. (excited)  28. - Joey - . There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested. (excited)  29. - Fey - . I'm just not. (frustrated)  30. - Joey - . I don't get it.  First time we came here to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.  And last year, I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here, you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car. (xxx)  31. - Fey - . Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions. (anger)  32. - Joey - . We weren't in a good spot. (xxx)  33. - Joey - . no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute. (excited)  34. - Joey - . Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map; (excited)  35. - Joey - . just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming. (excited)  36. - Joey - . They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge. (excited)  37. - Joey - . They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up. (excited)  38. - Fey - . That's the wind. (frustrated)  39. - Joey - . Well so what did you think? (excited)  40. - Fey - . About what? (frustrated) |
|1.  - Fey - Look at this, goose bumps. (neutral) 2. - Joey - . What I said. (neutral)  3. - Fey - . It's ridiculous. (xxx)  4. - Joey - . Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact. (frustrated)  5. - Fey - . Sure.  They're all told the same story.  It's what keeps us coming back for more; keeps us excited; keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we could just find the right spot; get in on the action. (xxx)  6. - Joey - . Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way, but are you having your period? (frustrated)  7. - Fey - . Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting. (anger)  8. - Joey - . There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home. (anger)  9. - Fey - . For heaven's sake, we are not going to see the grunions. (xxx)  10. - Joey - . Why not? (xxx)  11. - Fey - . We never do, do we?  Have we ever? (anger)  12. - Joey - . We've missed them twice. (xxx)  13. - Joey - . That's not ever. (xxx)  14. - Fey - . Twice is every time we've tried.  That's ever. (frustrated)  15. - Joey - . I thought you wanted to see them. (xxx)  16. - Fey - . You don't have any idea what I'm saying. (frustrated)  17. - Joey - . No, of course, not. (frustrated)  18. - Fey - . I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is. (anger)  19. - Joey - . It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over. (frustrated)  20. - Fey - . For heaven's sake, this is not about fish. (xxx)  21. - Joey - . Uh,okay.  So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals; (frustrated)  22. - Joey - . Uh. (frustrated)  23. - Fey - . It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork. (sad)  24. - Fey - . And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me, right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be. (xxx)  25. - Joey - . Wait a minute, I've got it. (neutral)  26. - Fey - . Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle. (sad)  27. - Joey - . It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course. (neutral)  28. - Fey - . I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things. (sad)  29. - Joey - . Sure.  Okay.  Alright.  I've got it.  Listen do you want to dance? (xxx)  30. - Fey - . No. (sad)  31. - Joey - . You want to get some champagne? (xxx)  32. - Fey - . No. (sad)  33. - Joey - . You want to get married again? (frustrated)  34. - Fey - . No. (frustrated)  35. - Joey - . What, you want a divorce? (frustrated)  36. - Fey - . No. (frustrated)  37. - Joey - . A vacation? (frustrated)  38. - Fey - . I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to. (anger)  39. - Joey - . Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No. (anger)  40. - Joey - . No, I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and wind in our hair and sand in our toes and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves. (xxx)  41. - Joey - . And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This. (anger)  42. - Fey - . This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything. (anger)  43. - Joey - . Yes, it is. (frustrated)  44. - Fey - . But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like. (anger)  45. - Joey - . No, I know, me neither. (anger)  46. - Fey - . This is just this.  I mean, it includes a lot and everything, but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say? (xxx)  47. - Joey - . I'm doing the best I can. (frustrated)  48. - Fey - . I know you are, Augie.  Really, I do.  I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything.  But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else. (frustrated)  49. - Joey - . Maybe if you were with somebody else, too, huh? (xxx)  50. - Fey - . I didn't say that. (sad)  51. - Joey - . No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy. (sad)  52. - Fey - . For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you. (xxx)  53. - Joey - . Yeah? (surprise)  54. - Fey - . Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else; somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard. (xxx)  55. - Joey - . Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't. (happy)  56. - Fey - . Okay, fine.  So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person. (happy)  57. - Joey - . Or not. (xxx) |
|1.  - Joey - Good God. (fear) 2. - Fey - . Nobody knows we're here, except Freda and she wouldn't ring up. (fear)  3. - Joey - . It must be them, then. (fear)  4. - Fey - . What are we to do? (fear)  5. - Joey - . I don't care, then. (excited)  6. - Fey - . It was bound to come sooner or later. (xxx)  7. - Joey - . Hello, hello.  What?  Wrong number. (xxx)  8. - Fey - . Oh, it sent shivers up my spine. (excited)  9. - Joey - . What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us? (excited)  10. - Fey - . Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey. (excited)  11. - Joey - . Ah.  Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter when one's happy, do they? (xxx)  12. - Fey - . But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy. (excited)  13. - Joey - . Don't say that, darling. (xxx)  14. - Fey - . It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke. (excited)  15. - Joey - . Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love? (neutral)  16. - Fey - . Yes, meaning just that. (xxx)  17. - Joey - . All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light. (anger)  18. - Fey - . If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too. (neutral)  19. - Joey - . Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright. (xxx)  20. - Fey - . How long will it last, this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours? (excited)  21. - Joey - . Who knows. (xxx)  22. - Fey - . Shall we always want to bicker and fight? (excited)  23. - Joey - . No.  That fire will fade along with our passion. (sad)  24. - Fey - . What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left, still laugh? (excited)  25. - Joey - . Yes.  Yes, with all his might. (xxx)  26. - Fey - . Well that's serious enough, isn't it? (excited)  27. - Joey - . No, no, it isn't.  Death's very laughable; such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors. (xxx)  28. - Fey - . Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense. (xxx)  29. - Joey - . So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and- and enjoy the party as much as we can, like very small, quite idiotic little school children. (xxx)  30. - Joey - . Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets. (excited)  31. - Fey - . Elliot, worms don't pop. (xxx)  32. - Joey - . I don't mind what you do, see?  You can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best. (xxx)  33. - Fey - . Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you. (excited)  34. - Joey - . Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice? (xxx)  35. - Fey - . Oh, Charles; that was his name, Charles.  Oh, he did wriggle so beautifully. (excited)  36. - Joey - . How long did that row last? (xxx)  37. - Fey - . It went on intermittently for days. (excited)  38. - Joey - . The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown. (xxx)  39. - Fey - . It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom. (excited)  40. - Joey - . Line? (neutral)  41. - Joey - . How -- that was a rouser wasn't it? (excited)  42. - Fey - . That was the first time you ever hit me. (excited)  43. - Joey - . I didn't hit you very hard. (xxx)  44. - Fey - . The manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear. (excited)  45. - Joey - . Ah, I shall never forget his face. (xxx)  46. - Fey - . And very much sillier. (excited)  47. - Joey - . As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. (neutral) |

If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it. (frustrated)  15. - Joey - . That's a nice point of view, I must say. (anger)  16. - Fey - . Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation. (frustrated)  17. - Joey - . So am I; bored stiff. (anger)  18. - Joey - . You want some brandy? (xxx)  19. - Fey - . No, thanks. (anger)  20. - Joey - . I'll have a little myself, I think. (frustrated)  21. - Fey - . I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses. (frustrated)  22. - Joey - . You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on. (frustrated)  23. - Fey - . It's become a habit with you. (anger)  24. - Joey - . You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment. (frustrated)  25. - Fey - . Oh, don't be so stupid. (frustrated)  26. - Joey - . Really, Amanda (anger)  27. - Fey - .

(neutral)  35. - Joey - . It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable. (anger)  36. - Fey - . It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you. (frustrated)  37. - Joey - . Line? (neutral)  38. - Joey - . Snap.  Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder. (anger)  39. - Fey - . Adders don't snap, they sting. (anger)  40. - Joey - .

You always had a weak head. (anger)  49. - Joey - . I think I mentioned once before that I've only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening.  That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk. (frustrated)  50. - Fey - . On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy. (anger)  51. - Joey - . Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine? (anger)  52. - Fey - . Oh, shut up. (anger)  53. - Joey - . We might get up a splendid little- a splendid little debate about this, you know, intemperate tots. (xxx)  54. - Fey - . Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy. (anger)  55. - Joey - . Very good idea.  I will (anger)  56. - Joey - . You better turn that off I think. (anger)  57. - Fey - . There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.

Turn it on again, please. (anger)  62. - Joey - . I will do no such thing. (xxx)  63. - Fey - . Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic. (anger)  64. - Joey - . Turn it off.  It's driving me mad. (anger)  65. - Fey - . Go away.  Go away.  I hate you. (anger)  66. - Joey - . Turn it off. (anger)  67. - Fey - . You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.

I can't come back over there.  I'll get security if you need me to. (frustrated)  29. - Fey - . Please, I don't think that's necessary.  I'm just asking, maybe you could call over and say that somebody miss informed her because I didn't pick to stand in this line.  I asked them where to stand, and they told me here.

Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher. (frustrated)  55. - Fey - . That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar. (anger)  56. - Joey - . Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?

Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me. (frustrated)  62. - Joey - . Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important? (neutral)  63. - Fey - . Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy. (frustrated)  64. - Joey - . Uh, so it was really heavy. (neutral)  65. - Fey - . So I would have carried it on, but they made me check it and then they lost it. (xxx)  66. - Joey - .

Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on? (frustrated)  88. - Fey - . Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous. (frustrated)  89. - Joey - . Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous (frustrated)  90. - Fey - . No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want. (anger)  91. - Joey - . Right. (neutral)  92. - Fey - . It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another. (anger)  93. - Joey - . I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen. (frustrated)  94. - Joey - . And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that. (neutral)  95. - Fey - . okay fine.

Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that. (neutral)  51. - Joey - . To hell with that! (anger)  52. - Fey - . Have you asked Annie yet to marry you? (neutral)  53. - Joey - . I want to get this settled first. (xxx)  54. - Fey - . Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father? (neutral)  55. - Joey - . Well, if she does, then that's the end of it, but from her letters it sounds like she's forgotten about it.  I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with Dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me. (xxx)  56. - Fey - . The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have (neutral)  57. - Joey - . So what, I'm not fast with women. (frustrated)  58. - Fey - .

I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram? (frustrated)  62. - Fey - . No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back. (frustrated)  63. - Fey - . You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't. (sad)  64. - Joey - . All right, then, Mom. (frustrated)  65. - Fey - . Give it some more thought. (xxx)  66. - Joey - .

But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out. (frustrated)  67. - Fey - . What the hell is this? (anger)  68. - Joey - . I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.

(xxx)  74. - Joey - . Yes!  I like it an hour a day.  If I had to grub for money all day long, I like to come home to something beautiful.  I want a family.  I want- I want kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to. and Annie is in the center of that, and now where do I find it? (xxx)  75. - Fey - . Don't- you, you can't think like that!  Don't think like that!

Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited. (frustrated)  16. - Joey - . How do you know why she's waited? (frustrated)  17. - Fey - .

Why are we arguing? (frustrated)  19. - Fey - . Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith.  Strangers might, but not his father, and not his brother. (frustrated)  20. - Joey - .

I can't stand alone. (xxx)  28. - Joey - . Calm yourself! (frustrated)  29. - Fey - . Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself. (anger)  30. - Joey - . All right, all right.  Calm yourself. (frustrated)  31. - Fey - . You above all, have got to believe, Joe. (xxx)  32. - Joey - . Why me, above all? (xxx)  33. - Fey - .

Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came. (sad)  13. - Joey - . Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set. (happy)  14. - Fey - . I figured they would- your mother at least. (xxx)  15. - Joey - . How did you know? (neutral)  16. - Fey - . Well, from her point of view why else would I come? (neutral)  17. - Joey - . Well, would you want to?  I guess you know this is why I asked you to come. (xxx)  18. - Fey - . I guess this is why I came. (happy)  19. - Joey - . Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you! (happy)  20. - Joey - . I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know. (excited)  21. - Joey - . You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything. (excited)  22. - Fey - . Chris, I've been ready for a long time. (xxx)  23. - Joey - .

You felt something that far back? (xxx)  28. - Fey - . Every day since. (xxx)  29. - Joey - . Annie, why didn't you say something to me? (xxx)  30. - Fey - . Well I was waiting for you!  I mean I didn't-until then you hadn't written and when you write- when you wrote what did you say?  I mean you sure can be ambiguous Chris. (xxx)  31. - Joey - . Give me a kiss, Ann. Give me a- (xxx)  32. - Joey - . Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this. (excited)  33. - Fey - . I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you! (happy)  34. - Joey - . Oh Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy. (excited)  35. - Fey - . Not like that, you're not. (happy)  36. - Joey - . I kissed you. (xxx)  37. - Fey - . Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  Chris, what's the matter? (happy)  38. - Joey - . Let's Let's drive someplace.  I- I want to be alone with you. (xxx)  39. - Fey - . No, what is it, your mother? (xxx)  40. - Joey - . No, nothing like that. (xxx)  41. - Fey - . What is it?  Even in your letters, there is something ashamed. (xxx)  42. - Joey - . Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me. (sad)  43. - Joey - . I don't know how to start. (xxx)  44. - Fey - . It wouldn't work like this. (sad)  45. - Joey - . It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I- (sad)  46. - Joey - . Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company. (sad)  47. - Fey - . yeah sure. (neutral)  48. - Joey - . Yeah.  I lost them. (sad)  49. - Fey - . how many? (sad)  50. - Joey - . just about all. (sad)  51. - Fey - . Oh gee. (sad)  52. - Joey - . Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men- (sad)  53. - Joey - . for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket. (sad)  54. - Joey - . I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other. (sad)  55. - Joey - . I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today. (sad)  56. - Joey - . And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and- (sad)  57. - Joey - . but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me? (sad)  58. - Joey - . And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them. (sad)  59. - Joey - . And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here. (sad)  60. - Joey - . It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again. (sad)  61. - Joey - . And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and (sad)  62. - Joey - . It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that! (sad)  63. - Joey - . And if you're not, then it's all just loot and it's got blood on it, and I don't want any of it!  And, I guess that included you. (xxx)  64. - Fey - . Do you still feel like that? (neutral)  65. - Joey - . I I want you now, Annie. (excited)  66. - Fey - . Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that. (sad)  67. - Joey - . Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune! (happy)  68. - Fey - . What would I do with a fortune? (happy) |

You want my jacket?  We should have bought a blanket.  Our blanket-.  This is great, isn't it? (excited)  17. - Joey - . I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the thing right about now. I can't believe I forgot.  And look at kid, I am surprise I make it out of the house about flies it. (excited)  18. - Joey - .

My point is what's the point in coming down here if we are just going to turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it? (xxx)  29. - Fey - . Not particularly. (neutral)  30. - Joey - . Why not? (frustrated)  31. - Fey - . I just don't. (neutral)  32. - Joey - . Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity. (excited)  33. - Joey - . Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up. (excited)  34. - Fey - . Pass up what?  Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die. (frustrated)  35. - Joey - . Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that. (excited)  36. - Joey - . This is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. Yeah (excited)  37. - Fey - . What are you so excited about?  I mean it's not--it's not rocket science we are talking about, its fish.  Its fish nobody even eats. (frustrated)  38. - Joey - . Yeah they do. (xxx)  39. - Fey - . Augie. (-)  40. - Joey - . Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.

A little bit of the unexplainable.  I can't understand how you could not be interested. (excited)  42. - Fey - . I am just not. (neutral)  43. - Joey - . For real? (surprise)  44. - Fey - . Yes. (neutral)  45. - Joey - . I don't get it, the first time we came out here, you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited that you stuff your toe pushing me out of the door and you didn't notice it until you got into the car. (xxx)  46. - Fey - . Last year you also remember, our shoes got wet and I got sand in my panties and we got into a big fight.  You had a sore throat and we did not see the grunions. (frustrated)  47. - Joey - . We weren't in a good spot. (frustrated)  48. - Fey - . We didn't see them the first time either. (frustrated)  49. - Joey - . We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I got a great instinct for these things. (xxx)  50. - Joey - . Look there, what's that?  Is it?  Is that a--Ah, it's a seaweed isn't it? (excited)  51. - Joey - . Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world.  I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second. (excited)  52. - Joey - . Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that. (excited)  53. - Joey - . It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming. (excited)  54. - Joey - . They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up. (excited)  55. - Fey - . That's the wind. (xxx)  56. - Joey - . Well, So what do you think? (excited) |
|1.  - Joey - Well, so?  What do you think? (excited) 2. - Fey - . About what? (xxx)  3. - Joey - . What I was just saying. (frustrated)  4. - Fey - . It's ridiculous. (xxx)  5. - Joey - . It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact. (neutral)  6. - Fey - . It's PR, somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to occur on the beach. (xxx)  7. - Joey - . I am not the only one, look at all these people. (neutral)  8. - Fey - . Yeah, they are all told the same thing.  They are all told that you know.  Gets them excited and they can't wait and that if they just get in on the right spot, than you than maybe life will start (xxx)  9. - Joey - . Are we talking about the same thing? (xxx)  10. - Fey - . I am sorry.  It's just fish to me. (frustrated)  11. - Joey - . Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period? (neutral)  12. - Fey - . God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting. (anger)  13. - Joey - . What's bugging you? (frustrated)  14. - Fey - . I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like. (frustrated)  15. - Joey - . There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing.  And we say, Oh, wow.  Look at the little fish.  They go home, we go home. (frustrated)  16. - Fey - . For heaven's sake Augie, grow up we are not going to see the grunions. (frustrated)  17. - Joey - . Why not? (frustrated)  18. - Fey - . We never do.  Have we ever?  We never have. (frustrated)  19. - Joey - . We miss them twice, it's not ever. (frustrated)  20. - Fey - . Twice is every time we tried, that's ever. (frustrated)  21. - Joey - . Well We will see them this year. (neutral)  22. - Fey - . No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up. (frustrated)  23. - Joey - . I thought you wanted to see it. (frustrated)  24. - Fey - . I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie. (frustrated)  25. - Joey - . It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over. (frustrated)  26. - Fey - . For heaven's sake, this is not about fish. (frustrated)  27. - Joey - . Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here. (frustrated)  28. - Joey - . When you are on the phone with Marge, everything was fine.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see, I took a shower and you were watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight and I said, great, let's go I am feeling lucky. (xxx)  29. - Joey - . Right, so I am putting on my jacket and putting up the animals and pulling the car out of the garage. (xxx)  30. - Fey - . Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant. (sad)  31. - Fey - . We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them. (sad)  32. - Fey - . And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be. (happy)  33. - Joey - . Wait a minute, I got it. (neutral)  34. - Fey - . Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle. (sad)  35. - Joey - . It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's get some champagne.  And I said time wasting or something like that.  Right? of course. (xxx)  36. - Fey - . I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things. (sad)  37. - Joey - . Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance? (excited)  38. - Fey - . No. (sad)  39. - Joey - . You want me to go get some champagne? (excited)  40. - Fey - . No. (sad)  41. - Joey - . Take off our shoes?

A bag of ice cream, a suicide pack, what what Carla?  What the hell do you want? (frustrated)  50. - Fey - . No. (-)  51. - Fey - . I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out. (frustrated)  52. - Joey - . What.  Welcome to the human race. (anger)  53. - Joey - . You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I propose I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road, we will end up on a beach arguing over fish. You think that I knew that there would be times when you will look at me like I am used Kleenex?  Or that I will look at you and think, holy hell what's the next flight to Alaska. (xxx)  54. - Joey - . No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us. (frustrated)  55. - Joey - . Because you know what Carla?  You know what you get?  This. (xxx)  56. - Fey - . This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything. (sad)  57. - Joey - . Yes it is. (xxx)  58. - Fey - . Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting. (sad)  59. - Joey - . Right. (xxx)  60. - Fey - . But this isn't anything like I thought it would be. (sad)  61. - Joey - . No, I know me either. (sad)  62. - Fey - . I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else. (sad)  63. - Joey - . Maybe if you are with somebody else too? (sad)  64. - Fey - . I didn't say that. (sad)  65. - Joey - . No, I know, but.  I know I don't make you happy. (sad)  66. - Fey - . For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you. (sad)  67. - Joey - . Yeah? (xxx)  68. - Fey - . For heaven's sake, don't you know that? (xxx)  69. - Fey - . Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself. (sad)  70. - Joey - . Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't. (happy)  71. - Fey - . Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person. (happy)  72. - Joey - . I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here. (happy)  73. - Fey - . Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon. (happy)  74. - Joey - . Well, look what we have got here. (happy)  75. - Fey - . Augie, you bought refreshments. (xxx)  76. - Joey - . Well, it's not champagne. (xxx)  77. - Fey - . Well than we don't need glasses. (xxx)  78. - Joey - . Are you still cold?  You still want to go home? (xxx)  79. - Fey - . No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all. (happy)  80. - Joey - . Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come. (happy)  81. - Fey - . Or not. (xxx)  82. - Joey - . Or not. (happy) |

You can hardly call three liqueur glasses of brandy in a whole evening going on and on. (xxx)  26. - Fey - . It's becoming a habit with you. (neutral)  27. - Joey - . You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment. (anger)  28. - Fey - . Don't be so stupid. (xxx)  29. - Joey - . Really, Amanda. (anger)  30. - Joey - . Going out somewhere, dear? (xxx)  31. - Fey - . Just making myself fascinating for you. (neutral)  32. - Joey - . Oh, that reply has broken my heart. (anger)  33. - Fey - .

Oh dear, you really are becoming quite insufferable.  I would imagine it's because you're drunk. (anger)  53. - Joey - . I'm not the least bit drunk. (xxx)  54. - Joey - . I think I mentioned once before that I had only three-minute liqueur glasses of brandy the entire evening long.  A child of two could not be drunk on that. (xxx)  55. - Fey - . Oh no, on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass. (xxx)  56. - Joey - . Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of three or a child of six?

Oh, marry you again?  I must have been insane.  What was I thinking?  I mean, you're completely outrageous. (anger)  85. - Joey - . Shut up, shut up.  I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again. (anger)  86. - Fey - .

Sir, please don't waste my time. (frustrated)  30. - Fey - . There is nothing I can do about it.  You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line.

I see -- you know, if I was-if I was your friend and you knew me, or something like that, you'd probably make a little exception for me wouldn't you? (frustrated)  32. - Fey - . They're different forms, we process them all different- (frustrated)  33. - Joey - . Wouldn't you? Oh, come on.  you just tell me.  You would make an exception for me. (anger)  34. - Fey - .

That's just dumb. (frustrated)  44. - Fey - . But you filled out the wrong form and you're in the wrong line and you're wasting both of our times. (frustrated)  45. - Joey - . I filled out the wrong form because they made me fill out the wrong form! (frustrated)  46. - Fey - . Well, that's unfortunate, sir.  You're gonna have to go stand in the other line now.

I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again. (frustrated)  3. - Joey - . This happens every two weeks? (neutral)  4. - Fey - . Yeah.  That my service just goes out. (frustrated)  5. - Joey - . You've lost your connection. (neutral)  6. - Fey - . yeah. (frustrated)  7. - Joey - . okay. (neutral)  8. - Fey - . And I'll reset the IP address.

Well, you know what, does your D.S.L. cable -- you have D.S.L., right? (neutral)  17. - Fey - . Hmm. Mmm. (neutral)  18. - Joey - . Okay.  Does your D.S.L. cable, you know, travel a long distance by any chance? - Does it go through any windows?  I mean, is it -- (neutral)  19. - Fey - . yeah. (neutral)  20. - Fey - . It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance. (neutral)  21. - Joey - . Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished. (neutral)  22. - Fey - . Oh really? (xxx)  23. - Joey - . Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection.  And it won't always be a bad connection, but it will be bad off and on. (neutral)  24. - Fey - . Well, I- I can check that.  Is there anything else we can do, too?  Like, I'll go through and check the line throughout the house, but -- (neutral)  25. - Joey - . Yeah, well, absolutely.  What we can -- let's just go ahead and just do a basic diagnostic of your system first off, okay.  Can you go down to your start button? (neutral)  26. - Fey - . Uh huh. (neutral)  27. - Joey - .

(neutral)  41. - Joey - . It's set to zeros.  Okay, maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again. (neutral)  42. - Fey - . Okay. (-)  43. - Fey - . what happening - So if we reset this, how will I know it's not going to happen again every other week? (xxx)  44. - Joey - .

Really? (surprise)  46. - Joey - . Of course.  we seriously- Yeah, I mean, obviously you've worked- you know -- I don't want to hassle you anymore. (neutral)  47. - Fey - . Oh, my God.  I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is.  I literally call and talk to five different people.  Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people.  And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now. (happy)  48. - Joey - . I completely understand. (neutral)  49. - Fey - . It's so frustrating. (frustrated)  50. - Joey - . Absolutely. And I just don't want that to happen to you anymore. (neutral)  51. - Fey - .

|1.  - Fey - What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it. (sad) 2. - Joey - . He saw it. (xxx)  3. - Fey - . When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it? (sad)  4. - Joey - . He was out here when it broke. (xxx)  5. - Fey - . When? (xxx)  6. - Joey - . I don't know, like, four o'clock this morning.  I heard a crack, and I woke up, and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it broke. (xxx)  7. - Fey - . What was he doing out here at four in the morning? (xxx)  8. - Joey - . I don't know, but after it broke he ran back inside and started crying in the kitchen. (xxx)  9. - Fey - . Did you talk to him? (sad)  10. - Joey - . No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone. (sad)  11. - Fey - . He cried hard? (sad)  12. - Joey - . I could hear him right through the floor in my room. (xxx)  13. - Fey - . What was he doing out there at that hour?  He's getting just like after Larry died, walking around at night.  He dreams. (xxx)  14. - Joey - . I guess he is. (xxx)  15. - Fey - . What's the meaning of that? (xxx)  16. - Joey - . I don't know the meaning of it, but you know one thing Mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad. (xxx)  17. - Fey - . What? (xxx)  18. - Joey - . Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off. (xxx)  19. - Fey - . What do you mean dishonest? (xxx)  20. - Joey - . You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him? (frustrated)  21. - Fey - . What do you want to do, argue with him? (frustrated)  22. - Joey - . I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore. (frustrated)  23. - Joey - . Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now? (anger)  24. - Fey - . You can't say that to him. (xxx)  25. - Joey - . We have to say it to him. (frustrated)  26. - Fey - . how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it? (frustrated)  27. - Joey - . For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane! (anger)  28. - Fey - . To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you? (frustrated)  29. - Joey - . Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you. (xxx)  30. - Fey - . The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry. (anger)  31. - Joey - . All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you? (frustrated)  32. - Fey - . Why? (xxx)  33. - Joey - . You know. (neutral)  34. - Fey - . Well, I have an idea.  But what's the story? (xxx)  35. - Joey - . I'm going to ask her to marry me. (neutral)  36. - Fey - . Well, that's your business, Chris. (xxx)  37. - Joey - . It's not just my business. (frustrated)  38. - Fey - . Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind. (anger)  39. - Joey - . So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it? (frustrated)  40. - Fey - . Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't -- (xxx)  41. - Joey - . Oh, so it isn't just my business? (anger)  42. - Fey - . I'm just saying. (frustrated)  43. - Joey - . You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God. (anger)  44. - Joey - . Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things. (anger)  45. - Fey - . I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl. (anger)  46. - Joey - . She is not Larry's girl! (anger)  47. - Fey - . From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you? (anger)  48. - Joey - . I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want, I have to pull back because I might hurt somebody else.  My whole bloody life; time after time after time. (frustrated)  49. - Fey - . Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that (neutral)  50. - Joey - . To hell with that! (anger)  51. - Fey - . Have you asked Annie yet? (neutral)  52. - Joey - . I wanted to get this taken care of first. (xxx)  53. - Fey - . Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you? (neutral)  54. - Joey - . Well, if that's the case, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters it sounds like she has forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me. (xxx)  55. - Fey - . Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women. (neutral)  56. - Joey - . So what?  I'm not fast with women. (anger)  57. - Fey - . Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie. (frustrated)  58. - Joey - . Because it is. (frustrated)  59. - Fey - . Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years. (frustrated)  60. - Joey - . I know her best, all right?  I don't know.  I grew up next to her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram? (frustrated)  61. - Fey - . No.  I don't want a -- look, your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because, I don't. (frustrated)  62. - Joey - . All right then, mom. (xxx)  63. - Fey - . Just give it some more thought. (xxx)  64. - Joey - . I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy. (anger)  65. - Joey - . But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out. (anger)  66. - Fey - . What the hell is this? (surprise)  67. - Joey - . I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York. (anger)  68. - Fey - . Are you crazy? (anger)  69. - Joey - . I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it. (anger)  70. - Fey - . What?  You mean?  Tell me something, you mean that you would leave the business? (xxx)  71. - Joey - . Yes.  On this, I would. (anger)  72. - Fey - . You can't think like that. (xxx)  73. - Joey - . Well, you help me stay here. (anger)  74. - Fey - . All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you. (anger)  75. - Joey - . I know that, mom.  Just, you help me stay here. (frustrated)  76. - Fey - . Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me? (anger)  77. - Joey - . I am thinking that way. (xxx)  78. - Fey - . I don't understand you, do I? (frustrated)  79. - Joey - .

No, because if she- he's not coming back then I'll kill myself. Laugh!  Laugh at me! (frustrated)  24. - Fey - . But why did that happen the very night she came back?

|1.  - Fey - You're the only one I know who loves his parents. (neutral) 2. - Joey - . I know.  It's going out of style, isn't it? (xxx)  3. - Fey - . It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet. (happy)  4. - Joey - . So, you're not sorry I came? (excited)  5. - Fey - . No.  But I'm not going to stay. (xxx)  6. - Joey - . Why? (surprise)  7. - Fey - . Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave. (neutral)  8. - Joey - . Well- (neutral)  9. - Fey - . You saw that.  And well you've been -- (xxx)  10. - Joey - . What? (xxx)  11. - Fey - . You've been sort of embarrassed since I got here. (xxx)  12. - Joey - . Well, I planned on kind of sneaking up on you in a period of a week or so, but they all take it for granted that we're set. (xxx)  13. - Fey - . I figured they would, your mother at least. (neutral)  14. - Joey - . How did you know? (xxx)  15. - Fey - . Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here? (neutral)  16. - Joey - . Well, so would you want to?  I mean, I guess you know that's why I asked you to come. (xxx)  17. - Fey - . Yes, that's why I came. (xxx)  18. - Joey - . Annie, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you. -I (xxx)  19. - Joey - . I don't know what to say.  I have no imagination.  That's all I have to say to you.  God, I'm embarrassing you. I-I didn't want to do this here. I- I wanted to do it someplace different, someplace where we could be new to each other. (xxx)  20. - Joey - . You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything. (excited)  21. - Fey - . Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time. (happy)  22. - Joey - . So he's gone forever then?  You sure? (xxx)  23. - Fey - . I almost got married two years ago. (sad)  24. - Joey - . Why didn't you? (surprise)  25. - Fey - . You started to write me. (xxx)  26. - Joey - . You felt something that far back? (happy)  27. - Fey - . Everyday since. (happy)  28. - Joey - . Annie, why didn't you call me or tell me? (xxx)  29. - Fey - . Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you sure can be ambiguous. (excited)  30. - Joey - . Give me a kiss, Annie.  Give me a -- (xxx)  31. - Joey - . oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that? (excited)  32. - Fey - . I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've sat around wondering if I was crazy for thinking of you. (xxx)  33. - Joey - . Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm going to make you so happy. (excited)  34. - Fey - . Not like that you're not. (excited)  35. - Joey - . I kissed you. (surprise)  36. - Fey - . Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter? (sad)  37. - Joey - . Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you. (sad)  38. - Fey - . No.  Chris, what is it?  Is it your mother? (xxx)  39. - Joey - . No, nothing like that. (sad)  40. - Fey - . You have to tell me. (xxx)  41. - Fey - . Even in your letters there was something ashamed. (sad)  42. - Joey - . Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going for me. (sad)  43. - Fey - . You have to tell me. (sad)  44. - Joey - . I don't I don't know where to start. (neutral)  45. - Fey - . It wouldn't work like this. (sad)  46. - Joey - . It's so mixed up with so many other things. (sad)  47. - Joey - . You remember when I was overseas, I was in command of a company? (xxx)  48. - Fey - . Yeah, sure. (neutral)  49. - Joey - . I lost them. (sad)  50. - Fey - . How many? (sad)  51. - Joey - . Just about all. (sad)  52. - Joey - . It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men. (sad)  53. - Joey - . For instance, there was this time, and it had been raining for several days, and this kid came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks, just put them in my pocket. (xxx)  54. - Joey - . I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other. (sad)  55. - Joey - . I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down. (sad)  56. - Joey - . Everything was being destroyed see, but I felt like something new was being created at the same time.  Like it kind of -- responsibility.  You know, man to man.  Do you understand what I'm saying? (xxx)  57. - Joey - . And and to see that again, to to bring that back on the earth again, like- like a monument that that would stand behind these men and and and it would make a difference to them. (xxx)  58. - Joey - . It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there. (sad)  59. - Joey - . I mean, the whole thing was like some kind of bus accident to them. (xxx)  60. - Joey - . So I went back to work for my dad and that whole rat race again. (xxx)  61. - Joey - . I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all. (sad)  62. - Joey - . It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean, (frustrated)  63. - Joey - . you can take those things out of the war, but if you're gonna drive that car you've got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man. And you've got to be a little bit better because of that.  Because if you're not, then it's all just loot and there's blood on it and I didn't want any of it. (frustrated)  64. - Joey - . And I guess that included you. (sad)  65. - Fey - . Do you still feel like that? (sad)  66. - Joey - . I want you now, Annie. (sad)  67. - Fey - . Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included. (sad)  68. - Fey - . And you father, he put hundreds of planes in the air and you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that. (xxx)  69. - Joey - . Oh, Annie, (excited)  70. - Fey - . [LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune? (happy)  71. - Joey - . Annie I am going to make you a fortune. (happy) |
|1.  - Joey - What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh, this is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though, so how are you doing? (excited) 2. - Fey - . Fine. (sad)  3. - Joey - . What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think? (excited)  4. - Joey - . This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight. (excited)  5. - Fey - . What flashlight? (neutral)  6. - Joey - . The flashlight.  The silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?  Stupid. (excited)  7. - Fey - . You mean our flashlight? (xxx)  8. - Joey - . Well- (xxx)  9. - Fey - . I mean, you kept saying my flashlight, the flashlight like it was only somehow yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel? (xxx)  10. - Joey - . Oh, no, of course, our flashlight.  Me flashlight is to you flashlight, naturally. (excited)  11. - Joey - . How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember? (excited)  12. - Fey - . Yes. (xxx)  13. - Joey - . Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.  Oh, this is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Oh, a six pack would be just the ticket right about now. (excited)  14. - Joey - . I can't believe I forgot.I'm like a little kid.  I'm surprised I made it out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh, [LAUGHTER] (excited)  15. - Joey - . Oh, I wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand. or something (excited)  16. - Fey - . I'm cold. (xxx)  17. - Joey - . Do you want my jacket? (excited)  18. - Fey - . It's after eleven.  Let's just go home. (xxx)  19. - Joey - . Are you kidding?  We just got here, we'd miss it.  What's the point of coming all the way out here if we're just going to turn around and go home? (xxx)  20. - Fey - . There is no point in coming out here. (xxx)  21. - Joey - . Right. (xxx)  22. - Fey - . That's my point. (xxx)  23. - Joey - . That's my point, too. (xxx)  24. - Fey - . So let's go. (xxx)  25. - Joey - . Oh, no, no, no.  no That's not my point.  My point is what's the point coming out here if we're just going to leave?  Don't you want to see it? (xxx)  26. - Fey - . Not particularly. (xxx)  27. - Joey - . Why not? (xxx)  28. - Fey - . I just don't. (xxx)  29. - Joey - . Oh (frustrated)  30. - Fey - . it's stupid. (xxx)  31. - Joey - . Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity. (excited)  32. - Joey - . I mean, Think about people in Kansas, they've got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up. (excited)  33. - Fey - . Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die. (frustrated)  34. - Joey - . Yeah, but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know, (excited)  35. - Joey - . and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that. (excited)  36. - Joey - . I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy. (excited)  37. - Fey - . What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science, this is just fish.  Fish nobody even eats. (frustrated)  38. - Joey - . Yeah, they do. (frustrated)  39. - Fey - . Augie. (frustrated)  40. - Joey - . All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested. (excited)  41. - Fey - . I'm just not. (sad)  42. - Joey - . For real? (frustrated)  43. - Fey - . Yes. (xxx)  44. - Joey - . I don't get it.  I mean, the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life. And last year I remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn't even notice until you got in the car. (frustrated)  45. - Fey - . Well, if you also remember last year we- our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, we had a big argument, you had a sore throat, and we didn't see the grunion. (frustrated)  46. - Joey - . We weren't in a good spot. (xxx)  47. - Fey - . We didn't see them the first time either. (frustrated)  48. - Joey - . We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got a great sense for these things. (xxx)  49. - Joey - . Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed. (excited)  50. - Joey - . Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second; (excited)  51. - Joey - . somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And- (excited)  52. - Joey - . And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name, (excited)  53. - Joey - . they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up. (excited)  54. - Fey - . That's the wind. (xxx)  55. - Joey - . Well, so what do you think? (excited) |
|1.  - Joey - Well, so, what do you think? (excited) 2. - Fey - . About what? (neutral)  3. - Joey - . What I was just saying. (excited)  4. - Fey - . It's ridiculous. (neutral)  5. - Joey - . It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact. (frustrated)  6. - Fey - . It's P.R. somebody sold you a bill of goods that this magical thing would be happening on the beach. (xxx)  7. - Joey - . I'm not the only one, look at all these people. (xxx)  8. - Fey - . Sure.  Everybody is told the same thing, it keeps us all excited.  It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start now any minute if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action. (xxx)  9. - Joey - . Are we talking about the same thing? (xxx)  10. - Fey - . I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me. (frustrated)  11. - Joey - . uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period? (neutral)  12. - Fey - . God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting. (anger)  13. - Joey - . What's bugging you then? (frustrated)  14. - Fey - . I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like. (frustrated)  15. - Joey - . It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home. (frustrated)  16. - Fey - . For God's sake, Augie.  It's- Grow up, we're not going to see the grunion. (xxx)  17. - Joey - . Why not? (xxx)  18. - Fey - . We We don't ever.  Have we ever? (frustrated)  19. - Joey - . We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever. (frustrated)  20. - Fey - . Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever (anger)  21. - Joey - . Well, we'll see them this year. (xxx)  22. - Fey - . No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up. (anger)  23. - Joey - . Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over. (frustrated)  24. - Fey - . You don't understand anything I am saying. (frustrated)  25. - Joey - . No, of course not. (frustrated)  26. - Fey - . I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is. (sad)  27. - Joey - . I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so -- (frustrated)  28. - Joey - . you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem.  All right.  So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.  And so, all right, and I'm putting on my coat, I'm putting out the animals, I'm pulling the car out of the garage. (frustrated)  29. - Fey - . Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them. (sad)  30. - Fey - . And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be. (sad)  31. - Joey - . Wait a minute.  I've got it. (xxx)  32. - Fey - . Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle. (sad)  33. - Joey - . It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right? (neutral)  34. - Fey - . I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something. (sad)  35. - Joey - . Okay.  All right No problem.  I totally understand. okey  um, listen.  Do you want to dance? (xxx)  36. - Fey - . No. (sad)  37. - Joey - . Do you want me to go get some champagne? (xxx)  38. - Fey - . No. (sad)  39. - Joey - . Take off our shoes? (xxx)  40. - Fey - . No. (sad)  41. - Joey - . What, you want me to blow in your ear? (frustrated)  42. - Fey - . [LAUGHTER] No. (xxx)  43. - Joey - . Do you want to get married again?- What?  What, do you want a divorce? (frustrated)  44. - Fey - . No. (-)  45. - Fey - . No. (xxx)  46. - Joey - . A vacation? (frustrated)  47. - Fey - . No. (sad)  48. - Joey - . A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want? (frustrated)  49. - Fey - . I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to. (sad)  50. - Joey - . Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish? (anger)  51. - Joey - . Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us! (anger)  52. - Joey - . Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This. (anger)  53. - Fey - . This?  What is this?  This isn't even anything. (xxx)  54. - Joey - . Yes, it is. (xxx)  55. - Fey - . Sure, this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting. (xxx)  56. - Joey - . Right. (frustrated)  57. - Fey - . But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be. (sad)  58. - Joey - . Now, I know.  Me either (sad)  59. - Fey - . This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense? (sad)  60. - Joey - . I'm trying the best I can. (sad)  61. - Fey - . I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but. (sad)  62. - Fey - . But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else. (sad)  63. - Joey - . Maybe if you're with somebody else, too? (sad)  64. - Fey - . I didn't say that. (sad)  65. - Joey - . No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy. (sad)  66. - Fey - . For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you. (sad)  67. - Joey - . Really? (surprise)  68. - Fey - . Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself. (sad)  69. - Joey - . Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't. (happy)  70. - Fey - . Okay.  Well, we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person. (xxx)  71. - Joey - . I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here. (happy)  72. - Fey - . Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon. (happy)  73. - Joey - . Oh, well look what we've got here. (happy)  74. - Fey - . Augie, you brought refreshments. (xxx)  75. - Joey - . Well, it isn't champagne. (happy)  76. - Fey - . Well, then we don't need glasses. (xxx)  77. - Joey - . Are you still cold?  Still want to go home? (xxx)  78. - Fey - . No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry. (happy)  79. - Joey - . Shh.  If we're really quiet, the fish might come. (xxx)  80. - Fey - . Or not. (happy)  81. - Joey - . Or not.

No.  That fire will fade along with our passion. (excited)  36. - Fey - . Oh, dear.  Shall we like that? (xxx)  37. - Joey - . Well, it depends on how well we played. (xxx)  38. - Fey - . What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then? (neutral)  39. - Joey - . Yes, yes, with all his might. (excited)  40. - Fey - . That's rather serious, isn't it? (xxx)  41. - Joey - . No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors. (excited)  42. - Fey - . Darling, I do believe you're talking nonsense. (xxx)  43. - Joey - . So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children. (excited)  44. - Joey - . [garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets. (excited)  45. - Fey - . Elliott, worms don't pop. (neutral)  46. - Joey - . I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best. (excited)  47. - Fey - . Uhh, Thank you, darling.  And the same goes for you, except that if I ever see you so much as look at another woman, I'll kill you. (xxx)  48. - Joey - . Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice? (excited)  49. - Fey - . Which particular one? (xxx)  50. - Joey - . The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed. (excited)  51. - Fey - . Awe, Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully. (xxx)  52. - Joey - . Horrible thing.  I hated it. (excited)  53. - Fey - . I know you did.  You threw it out the window into the Canal below.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that. (excited)  54. - Joey - . How long did that roue last? (excited)  55. - Fey - . It went on intermittently for days. (xxx)  56. - Joey - . Oh, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown? (excited)  57. - Fey - . Oh, It burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom. (excited)  58. - Joey - . [LAUGHTER] That was quit a rouser, wasn't it? (excited)  59. - Fey - . That was the first time you hit me. (xxx)  60. - Joey - . Oh, I didn't hit you very hard. (excited)  61. - Fey - . And then the manager came in and saw us all rolling all over the floor, biting and scratching one another. [LAUGHTER] (xxx)  62. - Joey - . I should never forget his face. [LAUGHTER] (excited)  63. - Fey - . How ridiculous, utterly ridiculous (xxx)  64. - Joey - . We were very much younger then. (excited)  65. - Fey - . Very much sillier. (xxx)  66. - Joey - . Come to think of it, the real cause of that roues was Peter Burden. (xxx)  67. - Fey - . You knew there was nothing in that. (neutral) |
|1.  - Joey - Come to think of it the real cause of that roue was Peter Burden. (xxx) 2. - Fey - . Oh You knew there was nothing in that. (xxx)  3. - Joey - . I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him. (xxx)  4. - Fey - . Only a trivial little broach. (neutral)  5. - Joey - . I remember it well, covered in diamonds and the worst possible taste. (xxx)  6. - Fey - . Not at all.  I quite like it.  I wear it often. (neutral)  7. - Joey - . You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. (xxx)  8. - Fey - . [garbage], No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination. (frustrated)  9. - Joey - . You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he? (frustrated)  10. - Fey - . Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious. (neutral)  11. - Joey - . He let him kiss you.  You said you did. (frustrated)  12. - Fey - . Well, what of it. (neutral)  13. - Joey - . what of it? (xxx)  14. - Fey - . Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me. (neutral)  15. - Joey - . What about me? (xxx)  16. - Fey - . Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never would have known about it. (xxx)  17. - Joey - . Well, that's a nice point of view I must say. (anger)  18. - Fey - . I'm getting very bored with this conversation. (frustrated)  19. - Joey - . Me, too, bored stiff. (anger)  20. - Joey - . Do you want some brandy? (neutral)  21. - Fey - . No thanks. (neutral)  22. - Joey - . I think I'll have a little. (neutral)  23. - Fey - . I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses. (xxx)  24. - Joey - . No particular reason.  Besides, they were little ones. (xxx)  25. - Fey - . Well, it seems silly to go on and on with such a thing. (xxx)  26. - Joey - . You can hardly say- You can hardly call three little liquor glasses of brandy for the entire evening going on and on. (xxx)  27. - Fey - . It's becoming a habit with you. (neutral)  28. - Joey - . You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want me at the moment. (xxx)  29. - Fey - . Don't be stupid. (frustrated)  30. - Joey - . Amanda, really. (anger)  31. - Fey - . What? (xxx)  32. - Joey - . Nothing.  Are you going out somewhere, darling? (frustrated)  33. - Fey - . Just making myself fascinating for you. (neutral)  34. - Joey - . Um- Well, that reply has just broken my heart. (frustrated)  35. - Fey - . It's a woman's job to allure the man.  Watch me a moment, won't you? (xxx)  36. - Joey - . Oh, as a matter of fact, that's perfectly true. (xxx)  37. - Fey - . No, it isn't. (anger)  38. - Joey - . Yes, it is. (xxx)  39. - Fey - . No, it it is not, be quiet. (anger)  40. - Joey - . It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable. (anger)  41. - Fey - . hum, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you. (xxx)  42. - Joey - . oh, Snap, snap, snap.  Like a little Adder. (xxx)  43. - Fey - . Adders don't snap, they sting. (xxx)  44. - Joey - . Nonsense, they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap! (frustrated)  45. - Fey - . They sting. (frustrated)  46. - Joey - . They snap. (anger)  47. - Fey - . Okay, I don't care if they roll about like hoops and bark, okay? (xxx)  48. - Joey - . So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce? (neutral)  49. - Fey - . Yes, I did quite a lot. (neutral)  50. - Joey - . You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh? (anger)  51. - Fey - . [LAUGHTER] Mind your own business. (xxx)  52. - Joey - . I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway. (anger)  53. - Fey - . You're quite insufferable.  I do imagine it's because you're drunk. (frustrated)  54. - Joey - . I am not the slightest bit drunk. (anger)  55. - Fey - . You always had a weak head. (neutral)  56. - Joey - . I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that. (anger)  57. - Fey - . Oh, no on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass. (xxx)  58. - Joey - . Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine? (anger)  59. - Fey - . Not- Would you shut up. (anger)  60. - Joey - . You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots. (anger)  61. - Fey - . You're not very funny, dear.  You better have some more brandy. (frustrated)  62. - Joey - . You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will. (anger)  63. - Joey - . You better turn that off, I think. (anger)  64. - Fey - . Why? (xxx)  65. - Joey - . Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs. (anger)  66. - Fey - . There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photography studio. (xxx)  67. - Joey - . Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose. (anger)  68. - Fey - . They're away in Tunis. (xxx)  69. - Joey - . This is no time of the year for Tunis. (anger)  70. - Fey - . Turn it on again, please. (xxx)  71. - Joey - . I do I shall do no such thing. (anger)  72. - Fey - . Very well.  If you have to be boorish and idiotic. (anger)  73. - Joey - . Turn it off.  It's driving me mad. (anger)  74. - Fey - . You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself. (anger)  75. - Joey - . Turn it off! (anger)  76. - Fey - . Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you. (anger)  77. - Joey - . Very amusing indeed. (anger)  78. - Fey - .

I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible. (anger)  81. - Joey - . You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again. (anger)  82. - Fey - . This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end. (anger)  83. - Joey - . Oh, you're not going like this. (anger)  84. - Fey - . Yes, I am.
