Excuse me.,c,c,neu
Do you have your forms?,q,q,fru
Yeah.,ag,ans,neu
Let me see them.,c,s,fru
Is there a problem?,q,q,neu
Who told you to get in this line?,q,q,fru
You did.,ans,ans,xxx
You were standing at the beginning and you directed me.,s,s,xxx
Okay. But I didn't tell you to get in this line if you are filling out this particular form.,s,s,fru
Well what's the problem?  Let me change it.,q,q,neu
This form is a Z.X.four.,s,s,fru
"You can't--  This is not the line for Z.X.four.  If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four, you need to have a different form of ID.",ans,ans,fru
What?  I'm getting an ID.  This is why I'm here.  My wallet was stolen.,s,s,fru
No. I need another set of ID to prove this is actually you.,s,s,fru
How am I supposed to get an ID without an ID?  How does a person get an ID in the first place?,q,q,fru
I don't know.  But I need an ID to pass this form along.  I can't just send it along without an ID.,ans,ans,fru
I'm here to get an ID.,s,s,fru
"No.  I need another ID, a separate one.",ans,s,fru
Like what?  Like a birth certificate?,q,q,fru
"A birth certificate, a passport...a student ID; didn't you go to school?  Anything?",q,s,fru
Who the hell has a birth certificate?,q,q,xxx
"Yes but my wallet was stolen, I don't have anything.  I don't have any credit cards, I don't have my ID.  Don't you have things on file here?",q,q,fru
"Yeah.  We keep it on file, but we need an ID to access that file.",ans,ans,fru
That's out of control.,o,o,ang
I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID.,o,o,ang
How long have you been working here?,q,q,fru
Actually too long.,ans,ans,xxx
"Clearly.  You know, do you have like a supervisor or something?",q,q,neu
Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back.,s,s,ang
That would - I would appreciate that.  Yeah.,a,a,fru
Did you get the mail? So you saw my letter?,q,q,sad
It's not fair.,o,o,xxx
Yeah.  I know.,ag,ag,sad
"I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back.",q,o,sad
I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't...,s,s,sad
"I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices.",o,o,neu
"I don't know, it's just not fair.  I think you've already made your sacrifice.",o,o,xxx
"There's people that have given more though, you know?",s,s,sad
I just don't see how they can make you leave when you have a new baby - we have a new kid.,o,o,fru
I know.,ag,ag,sad
Then why is that fair?  Why--,q,q,xxx
"There's babies over there, though, that need mothers.",ans,ans,neu
I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it.,q,q,sad
"I'm not okay with it, but I don't-- it's not like I have a choice.  I don't see what crying about it is going to fix.",ans,ans,xxx
I'm just trying to think of another way.  I'm just trying to...,s,s,xxx
"Just, you know, kicking myself.",s,s,sad
like you sign up because you need money and,o,s,xxx
things just aren't what they seem.,o,s,sad
This is a stupid war.,o,o,xxx
"We're doing the right thing, though.",o,o,xxx
I know.,ag,ag,fru
I just don't see why it has to be you.,o,o,sad
"If not me then, who?",q,q,sad
What am I going to do? Huh?,q,q,sad
"You'll videotape everything, yeah?",ans,ans,sad
Yeah.,ag,ag,sad
"Maybe you can send it to me, like stream it, yeah?",o,o,sad
Don't you guys have access to computers over there.,q,q,neu
Last month--  Yeah.,ans,ans,sad
I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you.,o,o,sad
I have to find sitters.,s,s,neu
I can't raise a baby by myself.  How?,q,q,sad
"We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh?  Because there is a day care down the street.",ans,ans,sad
I know.,ag,ag,neu
And your mother is close by.,s,s,neu
I'll send you lots of letters.,s,s,sad
And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures.,c,c,sad
It's just not fair.,o,o,fru
So what's up?  What's new?,q,q,neu
Well Vegas was awesome.,ans,ans,hap
Yeah.  I heard.,ag,ag,neu
"And, um, I got married.",s,s,hap
Shut up.  No- in Vegas?,q,q,sur
Yeah.  In the old town part.,ans,ans,hap
Who did you marry?,q,q,exc
Chuck. [LAUGHTER],oth,oth,xxx
Did you propose to you?,q,q,xxx
Um- Yes.  It was very romantic.,ans,ans,hap
It was at the slot machines.,s,s,hap
Oh.  The Wheel of Fortune slots?,q,q,xxx
"Uhuh, uhuh.  He won big and he-and he realized that the only thing that would make it better was me as his bride.",s,s,hap
He turned to you and was like...,s,s,neu
Hey.  Let's get married and I said okay.,s,s,xxx
[LAUGHTER] That's really romantic.,o,o,hap
"Yeah.  Well.  You know, because he's leaving the next day.",ag,ag,hap
Yeah.,ag,ag,neu
But we're going to have a honeymoon cruise.,s,s,hap
"Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship, too, in- in England or whatever?",q,q,neu
Oh.  I hadn't even thought about that.,s,ans,hap
Yeah.  Think about that.,c,c,xxx
"He's not going to be a citizen, though.",s,s,xxx
Yeah.  But he'll have like a long visa.  Can you go visit then for a long time?,q,q,neu
Oh.  Totally.,ag,ag,hap
"Oh, how are you going to do the long distance thing?  So wait, are you going to move there?",q,q,xxx
I guess I'll-  I guess I'll have an internet husband.[LAUGHTER],ans,ans,hap
Like you need another one of those.[LAUGHTER],o,o,hap
I have an internet boyfriend.  I guess I'll have to juggle the two.  Is that cheating?  I don't know. Hmm.,ans,o,xxx
Is that your phone?,q,q,hap
"Yeah, so [LAUGHTER] He's calling me now",ans,ans,exc
He loves you.,o,s,hap
"He likes to keep tabs, you know.",s,s,hap
How much did he win at the slot?,q,q,neu
"Uh, I think seven hundred and fifty dollars.",ans,ans,neu
Really? Penny slots?,q,q,sur
Penny slots. That's what he plays.,ans,ans,neu
Wow.,b,a,sur
Yeah.,ag,ag,neu
I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Fortune quarters. But it just costs so much.  I don't know.,s,s,neu
Oh.,b,b,xxx
Yeah.  We played Wheel of Fortune pennies.  It's like a giant thing with like-,s,s,hap
"But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks.",o,o,neu
Fifty bucks. Mmhmm.,ans,b,neu
"like, wait, but it's just pennies.  You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you.",o,o,neu
Yeah.,ag,ag,neu
Well so now we're married. We have cat children.,s,s,hap
Awesome.,o,a,exc
[LAUGHTER] Cat babies.,s,s,hap
"We renamed Brenda, Lumber Janet.",s,s,hap
That's fair enough.,o,o,neu
She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER],s,s,hap
"Have you tried, uh, Craig's List?",q,q,neu
"Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing?",q,q,neu
Yeah.,ag,ag,neu
I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that.,o,o,neu
No.  There's regular jobs on there.,dag,dag,neu
"I don't know.  I mean I've been looking for so long that I just figured that--  I mean, I think things like Monster are a lot more reliable than just some random free board.",o,o,fru
Uh huh.,b,b,neu
I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it.,s,s,neu
What kind of a job?,q,q,xxx
He's like a manager for a theatre.,ans,ans,neu
Really?,q,q,xxx
He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job.,ans,ans,neu
He just...,b,b,neu
you know what?  I heard about that job.  I applied for that.,s,s,neu
You did?,q,q,neu
Yeah.  I saw a posting at the theatre.,ans,ans,fru
Yeah.,ag,b,neu
He got it?,q,q,xxx
You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right?,q,q,neu
Yeah.,ag,ans,neu
Hmm.,b,b,neu
What did he do?  What was so great?  I don't understand why they would pick him over me.,q,q,xxx
I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and--,ans,ans,neu
A resume?,q,q,xxx
Yeah.  Do you have a resume?,q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,xxx
It's kind of helpful when getting a job.,o,o,neu
I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at.,s,s,neu
Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.,o,o,neu
Yeah.,ag,ag,neu
I don't like- I don't like sending things in the mail.  I don't want my information out there.,o,o,xxx
"No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--",s,s,neu
I'm there in front of them.  I'm telling them what I'm good at.,s,s,fru
"Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too.",o,o,neu
Why?  It's a piece of paper.,q,q,fru
"No.  But it has an outline, you know.",ans,ans,neu
"I just don't want this paper trail, you know.  I just don't want things following me around, like-.",s,s,fru
"I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe--",ag,ag,neu
"It's just-- You know, I've had this problem before.  You're not the first person to tell me that I need a resume but...",s,s,fru
Yeah.,ag,b,neu
"Okay, yeah.  I would imagine.",ag,ag,neu
..I just-..I just think it's kind of prejudiced and they are really discriminating against people who just aren't that way.,o,o,xxx
"Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now.",o,o,neu
"That's baloney, that's baloney.",o,o,fru
Please.,dag,dag,fru
maybe get a car.,o,o,neu
"I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe.",o,o,neu
you think that you're better than me because I don't have a car?,q,q,fru
I didn't say that.,dag,dag,neu
"You know, you're riding the bus, too.",o,s,fru
"I am riding the bus, but by choice.",o,o,neu
Why?  What choice?,q,q,fru
"To save the environment, carpool.",s,ans,neu
You're saving the environment. mmhmm,s,s,fru
Yes.  One less car at a time.,ag,ag,neu
Interesting.  That's fantastic.,o,a,fru
Mmhmm.,b,b,neu
"You know, you don't have to take out your frustration on me, you know, just because...",s,s,fru
I'm not frustrated.,dag,dag,ang
...you can't get a job and refuse to have a resume.,s,s,fru
Who do you think you are?,q,q,ang
I don't think I'm anyone.,ans,ans,neu
You are so high and mighty.  I just--,o,o,ang
I- I-I didn't-- okay.,b,b,neu
Oh.  I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to.,o,o,ang
What?  No.,q,dag,xxx
What? Oh.  So now you're...,s,s,fru
"The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to.",o,o,ang
you know what?  You don't have to take your anger and your hurt out on me.,c,c,fru
I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice.,o,o,ang
Why not?,q,q,xxx
Hi.,g,g,fru
Hi.  Thanks for waiting.,g,g,neu
Yeah. This is the fourth line that I have been in.,s,s,fru
Can I help you?,q,q,hap
Uh huh.,b,b,hap
I need my bag.,s,s,fru
Okay.,b,b,neu
"I flew in over three hours ago, I've been in four different lines.",s,s,fru
Okay.,b,b,neu
I waited the entire baggage- I waited for the whole baggage carousel four times.  They told me to go to the next one.  I waited through that for three planes and now I'm here.,s,s,fru
Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there.,q,q,neu
Nash.,ans,ans,fru
Okay.,b,b,neu
No G.,s,s,xxx
all right- okay.  And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue?,q,q,neu
Yes.,ans,ag,fru
Flight seven fourteen.,s,s,ang
Uh-huh.,b,b,neu
"Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here?",q,q,ang
"Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--",ans,ans,neu
"I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um-",ans,s,neu
"we've mistakenly lost your baggage.  We're very sorry.  On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience.  I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us.  I'm very sorry, once again...",ap,ap,neu
"Oh, Are you kidding me?",q,q,xxx
"for such an inconvenience and your bag, but",ap,ap,neu
Is this a joke?,q,q,ang
Yeah.,ag,b,neu
"No, no.",ans,dag,neu
"Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline.",q,q,ang
"No, no.  This is real.",ans,ans,neu
So you'll give me money and then I'll get my bag?,q,q,xxx
"No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because...",ap,ans,neu
this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere.,s,s,neu
"You're kidding me, this is a joke.",o,o,ang
"Once again, I'm really- I'm really sorry.",ap,ap,xxx
Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive.,q,q,ang
Yes.,ans,b,neu
I know.,ag,ag,neu
We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks.,s,s,ang
"I'm very sorry.  But if you see the sign that's right behind me here, it spells it out really clearly that we are not held liable--",ap,s,xxx
I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.,c,c,ang
Okay. Calm-,c,c,neu
"Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really",s,s,neu
Do you understand who my husband is?,q,q,ang
"If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it.",o,o,ang
"We are actually not even allowed--  you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars.  We don't have to do that.",s,s,neu
Oh-Oh.  It's a gift.  You're-You're helping me out here?,q,q,ang
It's a gift.,ans,ans,neu
"You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.",s,s,neu
You are cruising for a bruising.  You are in so much trouble.,o,o,ang
With the amount of--,s,s,neu
Who's in charge?  Who is the president of Jet Blue?,q,q,ang
"Um, actually, I don't know. I don't know. Oh really?",ans,ans,neu
Because I probably know him.,s,s,ang
Yeah.,ag,ag,ang
Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--,o,o,neu
"I don't want money, I want my clothes.",s,s,ang
"Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry.",ap,s,neu
What's your name?,q,q,ang
Oh.  My name is Sean. Hi.,ans,ans,neu
Sean.  Great. Do you have a badge number or something?,q,q,xxx
"Badge number?  Uh, no.  You can just take my employee number I guess.",ans,ans,sur
Okay.  I'll do that.,ag,ag,ang
Why?  Have I done something wrong?  Have I given you bad service?  I feel like I have done the best I could.,q,q,sur
I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet.,ans,ans,ang
"If you want, you can write a letter.  I can give you the address. Yes.  An angry--",s,s,neu
A letter? I'll make a personal phone call.,s,s,ang
"Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more...",o,o,neu
"I'm sorry, Joy.",ap,ap,sad
It's okay.,a,a,xxx
Is there anything I can get you?  Do you want me to take care of anything for you or...?,q,q,neu
"No, no, no.",ans,ans,xxx
...pick up anything?,q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,sad
You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out.,o,o,sad
That's sweet.,o,a,neu
Thank you.,g,g,neu
I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.,ans,s,sad
"I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city.",s,s,sad
Hmm.,b,b,neu
So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.,s,s,sad
So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And-,s,s,sad
"this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there.",s,s,neu
Oh.  She was there?,q,q,neu
"Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it.",o,s,sad
"And I, you know, I mean, I said I was sorry and I brought it back to her kind of and I like put it on the ground and she was like, no, it's fine.  She was like, I would rather have her back, honestly.",s,s,sad
Mmhmm.,b,b,neu
"I don't know.  It just, like, I felt so bad because I shouldn't have done it.  I don't know.  Whatever.",o,o,sad
Yeah.,ag,b,sad
I don't know.,s,s,sad
How long were you there for?,q,q,neu
At the cemetery?,q,q,sad
Mmhmm.,b,b,neu
couple hours.,ans,ans,sad
"I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day.  We ran through the sprinklers.",s,s,neu
Oh really?,q,q,neu
You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery?,q,q,neu
It was hot.[LIPSMACK],ans,ans,xxx
Is it a big cemetery?,q,q,neu
Yeah.  It's huge.  Redlands is an old city so they have lots and lots of stones.,ans,ans,neu
"Oh, so they're like really old too, really old ones?",q,q,neu
Yeah.,ag,ag,neu
"It's weird.  Whenever I go back to town, I think of her.  I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one.  And yeah.  She had cancer, she had two brain tumors.",o,s,sad
"My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her.",s,s,sad
She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day.,s,s,sad
Mmhmm.,b,b,neu
Umm. Yeah.,b,b,sad
"And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm...",s,s,sad
"But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool.",s,s,sad
Mmhmm.,b,b,neu
"Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and-",ans,ans,sad
So she wrote a lot of poetry?,q,q,neu
"There's another one, I can't remember.",ans,ans,neu
"I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know?",s,s,sad
Mmhmm.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.,b,b,xxx
Did you get the letter?,q,q,exc

So I get to mold young minds. Mrs.?  That's my mother.,o,o,exc

Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.,o,o,xxx
He saw it.,s,s,neu
How could he see it?  I was the first one up; he was still in bed.,q,q,sur
He was out here when it broke.,ans,ans,neu
When?,q,q,xxx
Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked.,ans,ans,neu
What was he doing out here at four o clock in the morning?,q,q,xxx
I don't know.,s,ans,neu
"He's dreaming of him again, walking around.",s,s,neu
I guess he is.,ag,ag,neu
It's getting to be just like after he died.  What's the meaning of that?,q,q,xxx
"I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing, Mom, you've made a terrible mistake with father.",ans,ans,fru
What?,q,q,xxx
"Being dishonest with him, you know.  This kind of thing always pays off and it's paying off.",ans,ans,xxx
What do you mean dishonest?,q,q,xxx
You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,ans,ans,neu
What do you want to do?  Argue with him?,q,q,fru
I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive.,ans,ans,fru
"You know?  Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him, dreaming of him?   Do we contradict him?  Do we say, we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years now?",o,o,fru
You can't say that to him.,ans,c,fru
We've got to say it to him.,c,dag,neu
Where's the proof?  Do you have any proof?,q,q,fru
"For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane.",ans,ans,fru
"To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face.  But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you?",o,o,fru
"Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.",c,c,neu
"It's that the trouble is those God damn newspapers.  Every month some new boy comes back and so the next one is going to be Larry, they just--",s,s,xxx
"All right, all right, all right.  You know why I asked Annie here, right?",q,q,fru
Why?,q,q,fru
You know.,ans,ans,neu
"Well I got an idea, but what's your story?",q,q,neu
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,ans,ans,neu
"Well that's only your business, Chris.",o,o,xxx
You know it's not just my business.,dag,dag,neu
Well what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,o,o,xxx
"So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it?",s,s,neu
Well you want to make sure that your father is not going to --,s,s,xxx
Then it's not just my business.,o,o,fru
I'm just saying.,s,s,xxx
"You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",o,o,ang
Oh.  I ignore what I got to ignore.  That girl is Larry's girl.,s,s,xxx
She's not Larry's girl.,dag,dag,fru
"From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl.",s,s,fru
"Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go.",s,s,fru
"I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time.",o,o,fru
"You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that.",o,o,fru
To hell with that.,dag,o,fru
I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet?,q,q,fru
I wanted to get this settled first.,ans,ans,neu
Well how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.,q,q,fru
"Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him.",ans,ans,neu
And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.,c,c,neu
The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,o,o,fru
So what.  I'm not fast with women.,ag,o,fru
Why does it have to be Annie?,q,q,fru
Because it is.,s,ans,fru
Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all.,dag,dag,fru
I don't know.,s,s,fru
"You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.",s,s,fru
"I can't help it, I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her, you know?  These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.",s,s,fru
"Mom, what do you want?  A diagram?",q,q,fru
I don't want a diagram.,ans,ans,fru
He thinks he's coming back Chris.,s,s,fru
"You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead...",s,s,fru
...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.,s,s,fru
"All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING]",a,ag,fru
Just give it some more thought.,c,c,neu
"I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy.",o,o,fru
"But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else.",s,s,fru
What the hell is this?,q,q,ang
"I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.",s,s,neu
Are you crazy?,q,q,xxx
"I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.",o,o,fru
You have a business here.  What the hell is this?,q,q,ang
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ans,ans,fru
Oh.  Must you be inspired?,q,q,ang
"Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy.",ans,ans,fru
"I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.  Now it's just where to find it.",o,o,fru
You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this?,q,q,fru
"On this, I would.",ans,ans,neu
Well you don't want to think like that.,s,c,fru
Then help me stay here.,c,c,neu
"All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.",s,s,ang
I know that.  Then just help me stay here.,c,c,fru
Just don't think like that.,c,c,ang
Well I am thinking like that.,s,s,fru
"I don't understand you, do I?",q,q,fru
No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,ans,ans,fru
I can see that.,ag,ag,fru
Why did he invite her here?,q,q,xxx
Why does that bother you?,q,q,xxx
"She's been in New York three and an half years, why all of a sudden?",q,q,xxx
Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.,ans,ans,neu
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,o,o,xxx
"What do you mean?  You know he lived next door to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her?",q,q,xxx
[BREATHING] You don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything more than he told you.,s,s,fru
He's not going to marry her.,c,c,ang
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,q,q,neu
It's got that about it.,ans,ans,ang
Oh.  So what.,b,b,xxx
"What is going on here, Joe?",q,q,ang
Now listen.,c,c,fru
She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.,s,s,ang
You can't read her mind.,o,s,fru
"Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.",q,q,ang
How do you know why she waited?,q,q,neu
"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.",ans,ans,ang
"Hey look, it's a nice day, huh?  Why are we arguing?",q,q,fru
"Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",o,o,ang
What do you want me to do? What do you want?,q,q,fru
"I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.",ans,ans,ang
I won't stand for any nonsense.,o,s,ang
Kate.,oth,oth,fru
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look.",s,o,ang
[BREATHING],oth,oth,fru
Calm yourself.,c,c,fru
"Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe.",s,s,ang
Okay. Calm yourself.,c,c,fru
"I know. All right, all right. All right. Okay.  Calm yourself. What does that mean, me above all?",q,q,fru
"Look at you, you're shaking.",s,s,xxx
I can't help it.,o,s,fru
"What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",q,q,ang
You're the only one who still loves his parents.,o,o,neu
"I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it?",q,q,neu
It's not so bad; it's a good thing.,ans,ans,neu
"[BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.",o,o,neu
You're not sorry you came.,q,q,neu
"I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay.",ans,ans,neu
Why not?,q,q,xxx
"For one thing, your mother much as told me to go.",ans,ans,neu
Well.,b,b,neu
"And then, you.  You've been kind of...",s,s,neu
What?,q,q,neu
Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.,o,o,neu
Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set.,s,s,neu
I knew they would.,ag,ag,neu
You did?,q,q,xxx
"Well sure, from your mother's point of view.  Why else would I come?",ans,ans,neu
"So would you want to?  I mean, I guess you have to know that's kind of why I asked you to come?",q,q,xxx
"I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came.",ans,ans,neu
[BREATHING],oth,oth,hap
"I love you. Annie, I love you.",o,s,hap
[LAUGHTER],oth,oth,hap
"I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say.",s,s,hap
[LAUGHTER],oth,oth,hap
"Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch.  I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us.",s,o,hap
No. No,dag,dag,hap
"You feel uncomfortable here, you feel that it's wrong here somehow.  I just...I don't...I didn't want...I didn't want to take you away from anything.",o,o,xxx
"Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time.",s,s,neu
And he's gone forever?  Are you sure?,q,q,xxx
I almost got married two years ago.,ans,ans,neu
Why didn't you?,q,q,xxx
You started to write me.,ans,ans,neu
You felt something that far back?,q,q,sur
Every day since.,ans,ans,hap
Why didn't you let me know?,q,q,hap
"I was waiting for you, Chris.  You sure can be ambiguous, you know.  And when you did finally write me,",ans,ans,xxx
Give me a...,c,c,hap
Give me a kiss.,c,c,hap
God.  I kissed you Annie.,s,s,xxx
beating around the bush.,ans,ans,hap
"I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me.",s,s,hap
"Oh Annie, we are going to live now.  I am going to make you so happy.",o,o,hap
Not like that you're not.,o,o,hap
I kissed you.,s,s,hap
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.",o,c,neu
"Chris, what is it?",q,q,xxx
"Hey, let's drive some place.  Huh?  Let's get out of here.",s,c,sad
No. What is it?  Is it your mother?,q,q,xxx
No it's nothing like that. It's-,dag,ans,sad
"Then what?  Chris.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed.",q,q,xxx
Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.,ans,ans,sad
You've got to tell me.,c,c,xxx
I don't even know how to start.,s,s,sad
It wouldn't work like this.,s,o,xxx
"It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company?",q,q,sad
"Yeah, sure.",ans,ag,neu
Well I lost them.,s,s,sad
How many?,q,q,neu
Pretty much all.,ans,ans,sad
"Aw, geez.",b,b,sad
You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?,o,o,sad
"Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.",s,s,sad
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.",o,o,sad
"And I had this idea as I was watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, you know, but this one thing was being made.  It was kind of a monument, it's kind of responsibility, man for man.",s,s,xxx
Mmhmm.,b,b,neu
"To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.",o,o,sad
"But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work.",s,s,sad
Driving my new car and seeing a new refrigerator.,s,s,xxx
"I mean...You can't take those things out of a war. when you drive that car and you see that new refrigerator, you have to know that it came out of the love that a man can have for another man.",o,o,xxx
And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.,o,o,sad
Do you still feel that way?,q,q,xxx
I just want you to know Annie.,ans,ans,neu
"Because you mustn't feel that way.  Everything you have, you've earned - everything.  you understand me?",q,q,xxx
"Even me.  And your money?  Chris, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes into the air, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.",o,o,xxx
"Annie, Annie.  I am going to make a fortune for you.",o,s,xxx
What would I do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
"What time is it?  I think it's supposed to run around midnight, right?  God, this is great, isn't it, Carla?  Look at this night we got here, huh.",o,a,xxx
"Actually I want to get a little further up the coast, get away from all like the lights and the people, but...  How are you doing?",q,q,xxx
Fine.,ans,ans,neu
"Okay.  Is that, is that--",ag,ag,exc
No.  That's just foam.  I don't know.  I can't tell.,ans,s,xxx
[BREATHING],oth,oth,fru
"I don't know, probably if you can't tell, though, it's probably not them, right?  It's probably going to be like this unmistakable thing, right?",o,o,xxx
Oh no.  you know what I forgot?,q,q,xxx
What?,q,q,xxx
"My flashlight.  God, how could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.",ans,ans,xxx
What flashlight?,q,q,sur
"The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?",ans,ans,neu
That's not your flashlight.,s,dag,neu
Whose is it?,q,q,neu
It's ours; it's my flashlight too.,ans,ans,xxx
"Oh...well. Yeah, of course.",ag,ag,neu
You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.,s,s,ang
No.,ans,dag,neu
How's that supposed to make me feel?,q,q,ang
"Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight.",ans,ans,neu
"Naturally.  God, how could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out, though.",o,o,fru
Do they always run during a full moon?  I don't remember.  Was it full last year?,q,q,neu
Yeah.,ag,ans,neu
"Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket.",q,q,neu
"Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh?",s,o,neu
"God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up.",o,o,exc
[LAUGHTER],oth,oth,hap
I wonder if they can hear me talk or like feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.,o,o,xxx
I'm cold.,s,s,sad
Do you want my jacket?,q,q,fru
"It's after eleven, let's go.",c,c,xxx
What?  We just got here.  What's the point of coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home?,q,q,xxx
There is no point.,ans,ans,xxx
Right.,ag,ag,neu
That's my point.,s,s,xxx
"Wait, that's my point, too.",s,s,neu
"Well, then let's go.",c,c,fru
"No, no.  Okay.  That's not my point.  My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?",dag,q,fru
Not particularly.,ans,ans,neu
Why not?,q,q,neu
I just don't.  It's stupid.,ans,ans,xxx
"Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up.",o,o,neu
"Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die.",s,s,fru
Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.,s,o,neu
This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy.,o,o,neu
I don't see why you're so excited; this isn't a freaking moon landing we are talking about.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.,o,o,xxx
Yeah they do.,dag,dag,fru
Oh Augie,b,b,fru
"okay... well, Whatever.  But it's a fish who do something no other fish do.  It's like those swallows returning to Capistrano or like those lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs.",o,o,xxx
"There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested.",o,o,neu
I'm just not.,s,s,xxx
For real?,q,q,sur
Yeah.,ag,ans,fru
"God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life?",q,s,neu
"And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.",s,s,neu
"Last time, you'll also remember, we got our shoes wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat and we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.",s,s,xxx
Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.,s,s,neu
Hmm.  We didn't see them the year before either.,s,s,fru
"We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things.",o,o,neu
"Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed.",s,s,exc
"God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this.",c,c,hap
"Right now out there, there is this mass of silver fish and it's heading this way.  No one sent them an invitation, no one told them, no one even gave them a map.",s,s,xxx
"Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming.",s,s,exc
They are swimming right now.  They are swimming as if that is the only thing that matters to them.,o,o,xxx
It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge.,o,o,exc
And they are swimming right now to this very point where we stand for this huge celebration of sex and death.,s,s,xxx
"Oh look.  I'm giving myself goose bumps, my hairs are standing up on my arm.",s,s,xxx
That's the wind.,s,o,neu
So what do you think?,q,q,hap
About what?,q,q,neu
"About all of that, about all I was talking about.",ans,ans,hap
"Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm.",c,c,exc
That's the wind.,s,o,neu
"Well, so, what do you think?",q,q,exc
About what?,q,q,neu
About what I was saying.,ans,ans,neu
I think it's ridiculous.,o,o,xxx
It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,dag,dag,xxx
It's PR! Somebody sold you a bunch of crap that there is this wonderful thing that is going to happen tonight on the beach.,o,o,xxx
"Not just me, look at all of these people.",dag,s,fru
"Everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us coming back for more, it keeps us excited.  We keep thinking that life is going start at any minute if we can just find the right spot, get in on the action.",o,o,xxx
"Are we talking about the same thing, here?",q,q,xxx
"I'm sorry, it's just fish to me.",ans,ap,xxx
"Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?",q,q,neu
"Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting.",ans,ans,ang
"Well then, what's bugging you?",q,q,fru
We just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like.,ans,ans,fru
"There is nothing to it; we come down here, the fish arrive, they flop around, they do their fish thing.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish and we go home.",s,s,fru
"For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive.",o,o,ang
Why not?,q,q,fru
Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever?,q,q,ang
We've missed them twice.,ans,ans,fru
Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.,s,s,ang
They'll show up this time.,o,o,fru
No they won't.  It's like waiting for Santa Claus.,dag,dag,xxx
I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish never show up.,s,s,fru
I thought you wanted to see it.,o,o,xxx
You don't understand anything I am saying.,s,dag,fru
No. Of course not.,dag,ag,fru
"I did want to see it, I still do, I always do.  I just...",s,s,xxx
"I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is.",o,o,sad
"It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatized over.",o,o,fru
"For God's sake, this is not about fish.",s,dag,ang
Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here.,s,s,fru
"Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go.",s,s,neu
"Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage.",s,s,neu
Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married.,s,s,neu
"We thought I was pregnant, we got a bottle of champagne, we had no glasses.  We took off our shoes and you asked me to dance.",s,s,xxx
"You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be.",s,s,hap
"Wait a minute, I got it.",c,c,xxx
"Drinking champagne from the bottle,",s,s,xxx
"It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that.",s,s,neu
dancing barefoot in the sand.,s,s,fru
"That's what it is?  Right?  You want this to be like the other time, right?",q,q,fru
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,ans,ans,sad
Sure.  All right.  Okay.,ag,ag,neu
"Listen, do you want to dance?",q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,neu
Do you want me to go get some champagne?,q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,xxx
Do you want to take off your shoes?,q,q,hap
"No, no. Nothing.",ans,ans,fru
Then what?,q,q,xxx
Do you want to get married again?,q,q,hap
No.,ans,ans,neu
What?  What?  Do you want a divorce?,q,q,oth
A vacation?,q,q,xxx
No.,ans,ans,fru
Like a new carpet?  A poodle?  A back rub?  Ice cream?  A suicide pact?  What do you want?  What the hell do you want?,q,q,xxx
I just want something to turn out like I expected it to.,ans,ans,xxx
"Well welcome to the human race, huh?  Do you think I had some grand fantasy going that four years down the line we would come to this beach and be arguing over fish?  No.",o,o,xxx

I didn't say that.,dag,dag,sad

Yes.  Yes with all of his might.,ans,ans,exc

It was a terrible thing.  I hated it.,o,o,dis

How long did that row last?,q,q,xxx
It went on intermittently for days.,ans,ans,xxx
Uh huh.,b,b,xxx

We were very much younger then.,s,s,xxx
And very much sillier.,o,o,hap
However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,o,o,neu
Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.,dag,s,hap
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,s,s,neu
"Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch.",s,s,hap
"It was bristling with diamonds.  In the worst possible taste, too.",s,s,xxx
"It was not.  I still have it, and I wear it often.  It is very pretty.",dag,dag,xxx
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,s,o,neu
I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,dag,dag,neu
"Well, you let him kiss you, huh?  You said you did.",s,s,fru
"Well, what of it?",q,q,neu
What of it?,b,q,xxx
It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,s,ans,xxx
What about me?,q,q,ang

Oh dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.,o,o,fru
So am I.  I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE]  Do you want some brandy?,q,q,fru
No.  Thank you.,ans,ans,xxx

"I don't know why you'd want any, you've already had three glasses.",o,o,xxx
"No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones.",s,s,neu
I just think it's silly to go on and on and on about such a thing.,o,o,xxx
"You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on.",o,o,fru
It's become a habit with you.,o,o,xxx
Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment.,o,o,fru
Don't be stupid.,c,c,ang

No it isn't.,dag,dag,ang
Yes it is.,dag,dag,neu
You shut up.,c,c,ang

Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap.,dag,dag,ang
They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.,o,o,ang
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,q,q,ang
"Yes I did, quite a lot.",ans,ans,ang
"And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow.",o,o,ang
Mind your own business.,c,c,ang
"You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk.",o,o,ang
I think I am not in the least bit drunk.,o,o,ang
You've always had a weak head.,o,o,ang
I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.,o,s,ang
"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",o,o,ang
"That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four?  Or a child of six?  Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots.",q,o,ang
Oh shut up.,c,c,ang
Shut up.,c,c,ang

There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.,s,s,neu
Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.,q,s,ang
They are away in Tunis.,ans,s,neu
This is no time of year for Tunis.,o,o,neu

I will do no such thing.,dag,dag,ang
Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,o,o,ang
"Will you turn that off, it's driving me mad.",q,q,ang
"You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself.",o,o,ang
Turn it off.,c,c,ang
"I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",o,o,ang

Oh.  That's very amusing indeed.,dag,o,ang

"He's dreaming about him again, walking the streets.",s,s,ang

It's getting to be just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that?,q,q,xxx
I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know we've made terrible mistake with father.,o,o,fru
What?,q,q,sur
"I mean, these kinds of things, man they always come back at you.  And this is definitely coming back to us.",o,ans,xxx
What do you mean a mistake?,q,q,ang
"I just--why shouldn't he walk the nights waiting for him, huh?  Do we contradict him do we say we don't have any hope any more that he's not coming back?",q,q,fru
"What do you want to do, argue with him?",q,q,fru
"I don't want to argue with him, it's just for God's sake it's time he realized that no one believes with him any more.",ans,ans,fru
You can't say that to him.,ans,c,xxx
I got to.,dag,dag,fru
"What, can you prove it?  What proof do you have?  Can you prove it?",q,q,ang
"For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane.",ans,o,fru
"To you it is, to me it is.  But to your father?  You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body.  So where are you?",o,o,ang
"Okay, all right.  Mom, sit down.  I want to talk to you.",s,s,fru
The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so--,s,s,ang
"Yeah, okay all right, all right.  Listen, um, you know why I asked Annie here, right?",q,q,fru
Why?,q,q,ang
You know.,ans,ans,xxx

You know it's not just my business.,dag,dag,fru
"Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business.",o,o,ang
So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it?,q,s,fru
You want to make sure that your father's not going to...,s,s,xxx
"See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh?",o,o,ang
I'm just saying.,s,s,fru
I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.,ans,s,ang
She is not Larry's girl.,dag,dag,ang
"From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.",s,s,ang
I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.  All my life...,o,o,fru
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.,o,o,neu
To hell with that.,dag,o,ang
Did you ask Annie yet?,q,q,neu
"No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first.",ans,ans,sad
"Well, how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels same way your father does.",q,q,fru
"Well, if she does then that's the end of it.  However from her letters I think she's pretty much forgotten him.",ans,ans,xxx
"The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.",o,o,fru
So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women.,o,o,fru
I don't see why it has to be Annie.,s,q,ang
Because it is.,s,ans,fru
"That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.",s,s,ang
"I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her.  She is what I think of when I think of a wife.",s,s,fru
"He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.",s,s,sad
"Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't.",s,q,ang
All right then.,a,a,xxx
Give it some more thought.,c,c,xxx
I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing.,s,s,fru
"When I think of a family, when I think of my future I see Annie in the center of that and you know and if that can't happen here then I'll go somewhere else.",o,o,fru
What the hell is this?,q,q,sur
I'll leave.  I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York.,ans,ans,fru
Are you crazy?,q,q,ang
I'll do it.,ans,s,xxx
You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this?,q,q,ang
Business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ans,ans,ang
"Oh, must you be inspired.",q,q,ang
"Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that.",ans,ans,ang
If that can't happen here...,s,s,fru
You mean to tell me you would leave the business for this.,q,q,xxx
"Yes, on this I would.",ans,ans,neu
"Well, you don't want to think like that.",c,c,ang
Then help me stay here mom.,c,c,sad
"All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you.",s,s,ang
"I know, I know.",ag,ag,xxx
Then help me stay.,c,c,sad
"Well, you don't think like that.",c,c,ang
I am thinking like that.,dag,s,ang
"I don't understand you, do I?",q,q,ang
"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",ans,ans,sad
"Well, I can see that.",ag,ag,ang
Why did he invite her here?,q,q,ang
"Well, maybe he wanted see her.",ans,ans,neu
It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden?,q,q,ang
"Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her?",q,q,neu
Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything he told you.,c,s,fru
He's not going to marry her.,c,c,xxx
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,q,q,fru
it's got that about it.,ans,ans,xxx
Oh so what?,q,b,fru
"What is going on here, Joe?",q,ans,ang
"Okay, now listen, kids...",c,c,fru
The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not.,s,s,ang
Listen. Line. You can't read her mind.,s,s,fru
Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men probably a hundred people told her she is crazy but she is waited.,q,q,xxx
And how do you know why she's waited.,q,q,neu
Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock. in my darkest moments I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.,ans,ans,xxx
"Okay, look it's a beautiful day.  Why are we arguing?",q,q,fru
"Nobody in this house dares take away her faith Joe.  Her- strangers might but not her father, not her brother.",o,o,fru
What do you want me to do?  What do you want?,q,q,fru
"I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",o,o,ang
Kate...,oth,oth,fru
Because if he's not coming back then I'll kill myself.,o,o,xxx
[BREATHING],oth,oth,fru
"Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look.",o,o,ang
"All right, calm yourself.",c,c,fru
"Believe with me Joe, you got to believe. Only last week a boy came back missing longer then Larry you read it yourself.",s,s,ang
"Okay, calm yourself. Alright.",c,c,fru

You above all have got to believe. Just don't stop believing.,o,c,ang

You're not sorry you came?,q,q,hap
"Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here.",ans,ans,sad
Why not?,q,q,sad
For one thing your mother as much as told me to go.,ans,ans,neu
Well.,b,b,xxx
[BREATHING] And then you've been kind of...,s,s,sad
What?,q,q,neu
You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.,o,o,sad
"I was kind of planning on sneaking up on you, you know over like a course of a week or so. They just take for granted that we're already set.",s,s,xxx
"I knew they would, your mother anyway.",ag,ag,xxx
You did?,q,q,neu
From her point of view why else would I come?,ans,ans,neu
Yeah--,ag,ag,neu
"So then would you want to?  I mean I guess, you kind of have to know, maybe that's why I asked you to come.",q,q,xxx
Well I guess that's why I came.,o,ans,xxx
"Ann, I love you.  I love you.",o,s,hap
I love you a great deal.,o,s,xxx
I'm sorry I don't really have much of an imagination.,ap,ap,xxx

"I've been ready a long, long time.",s,s,xxx
So then he's gone.  You sure?,q,q,xxx
I almost got married two years ago.,ans,s,neu
Why didn't you?,q,q,neu
You started to write me.,ans,ans,xxx
You felt something that far back?,q,q,xxx
Everyday since.,ans,ans,exc
why didn't you let me know?,q,q,exc
"Because I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote me and then when you did, well, you sure can be ambiguous you know.",ans,ans,exc
"Oh Annie, why don't you go ahead and give me a kiss, come on just a...",c,c,xxx
I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.,s,s,exc
I'll never forgive you for waiting so long.  All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you.,s,s,hap
I kissed you.,s,s,hap
"Like Larry's brother.  Do what like you, Chris.",s,s,xxx
"Chris, what's the matter?",q,q,sad
Do you want to go somewhere?  Let's go.,q,q,sad
"No, what is it?  Is your mother?",q,q,sad
"No, no, it's nothing like that.",ans,ans,sad
"Well, then what?  You know, even in your letter you seem kind of ashamed.",q,q,xxx
I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now.,ans,ans,sad
You got to tell me.,c,c,sad
I don't know.,s,s,sad
It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.,s,s,sad
Wouldn't work like this.,o,o,sad

"Yeah, sure.",ans,ag,sad
Well I lost them.,s,s,sad
How many?,q,q,sad
Pretty much all.,ans,ans,sad
[BREATHING]. Geez.,b,b,sad
"Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men, you know.",o,o,sad
"For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.",s,s,sad
He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had.,s,s,sad
"They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today...",o,o,sad
"And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument...",s,s,sad
"You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know.",o,o,sad
"I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all...",s,s,sad
You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again...,s,s,sad
And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.,s,s,sad
Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.,s,s,sad
Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...,o,o,sad
And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it.,o,o,sad
I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too.,o,o,sad
Do you still feel that way?,q,q,sad
I want you to know Annie.,ans,ans,sad
"Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Everything you have, you have a right to...",o,o,xxx
Everything Chris do you understand that?  To me too...,ans,q,xxx
And your money there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes into the air.  You should be proud of that a man should be paid for that.,o,o,xxx
Annie...,b,b,xxx
I'm going to make a fortune for you.,s,s,hap
What would I do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
"What time is it?  God, this is great, isn't it?  I can't believe it.",q,q,exc
"Of course I did want to a little further up the coast you know get away from all the lights and people and everything.  Is it midnight, do they always start at midnight?  Is that what it is midnight?  How you doing, huh? You okay?  That's good.",q,q,exc
I'm fine.,ans,ans,xxx
"Look, there what's that, what's that?  Is it--",q,q,exc
"No, I think that's just foam.",ans,ans,xxx
Ugh...,b,b,fru
"Oh, no I can't tell though.  Although probably if you can't tell it probably isn't them right, yeah.  Probably going to be like unmistakable, right?",o,o,exc
"Gosh, this is great, isn't it?  This is awesome.  Oh, no you know what I forgot?",q,q,exc
My flashlight.  How could I forget my flashlight?  God--,ans,ans,xxx
What flashlight?,q,q,sur
Flashlight the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?,ans,ans,neu
That's not your flashlight.,s,dag,xxx
Whose is it?,q,q,xxx
"It's ours; it's my flashlight, too.",ans,ans,xxx
"Oh, well, yeah of course.",ag,ag,neu
"You keep saying ""my flashlight"" like somehow it's just yours. How's that supposed to make me feel?",q,q,ang
"Of course, our flashlight.  What's your is mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight.",ans,ans,neu
"Gosh, I should have brought it. I can't believe I forgot that.",s,s,neu
"It's a nice moon though, should stay full.  Do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember was it full last year?",q,q,xxx
Yeah.,ag,ans,xxx
Are you all right?  Are you okay?  You cold?  Do you want to my jacket? My jacket? No?,q,q,xxx
No.,ans,ans,neu
"You know what we should've brought a blanket too.  Man, our blanket, our blanket.  Wish I had six-pack too, a six-pack would be just the ticket right about now, huh, six-pack.",o,o,exc
What's wrong?  Are you okay?  Huh?  You cold?,q,q,xxx
I'm fine.,ans,ans,neu
"Oh yeah, I'm so excited right now I'm like a kid.",o,o,exc
I can't believe I got out of the house without my fly zipped up even.,o,o,exc
I wonder if they can hear me talk,o,o,hap
"I wonder if they can hear me talking, you know.",o,o,xxx
Like feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.,o,o,xxx
I'm cold.,s,s,fru
Do you want my jacket?,q,q,fru
"It's after eleven, let's go home.",s,c,fru
What are you kidding?  We just got here.  We don't want to turn around and go home now.  What's the point coming all the way down here?,q,q,fru
There is no point.,ans,ans,fru
Right.,ag,ag,neu
That's my point.,s,s,fru
That's my point too.,ag,s,neu
Then let's go.,c,c,ang
"No, wait no, no that's not my point.  My point is there is no point and coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home.",dag,s,fru
Don't you want to see it?,q,q,xxx
Not particularly.,ans,ans,xxx
Why not?,q,q,fru
"I just don't, it's stupid.",ans,ans,xxx
It's not stupid.  It's a natural phenomenon.,o,o,fru
People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.,o,o,ang
"Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die.",s,s,ang
Yeah but that like flopping around is what to do it's like spawning or mating or something.  This is like the highlight of their little fish lives.  It's like life's last orgy.,s,s,xxx
"I don't know what you're so excited about.  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about, it's fish, it's a fish nobody even eats.",o,o,fru
"Yeah, they do.",dag,dag,neu
"Oh, Augie.",b,b,fru
"Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know.",o,o,exc
"It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this.",o,o,exc
I'm not.,s,s,fru
For real?,q,q,xxx
Yes.,ans,ans,ang
All right.,ag,ag,fru
"I don't get it though, I mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life...",s,s,fru
And last year I remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn't realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car.,s,s,fru
"Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.",s,s,ang
We just weren't in a good spot though.,s,s,neu
We didn't see them the year before either.,s,s,ang
We just weren't in a good spot I'm telling you this is a much better spot.,o,o,xxx
"Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay?  So just--just think about it all right?  Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it...",c,c,neu
"Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way...",s,s,exc
"They don't know why, we don't know why.  No one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction...",s,s,exc
They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming...,s,s,exc
Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one...,s,s,exc
"And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here...",s,s,exc
It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind.,s,s,exc
"It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm.",o,s,exc
That's the wind.,s,o,xxx
They're out there swimming right now...,s,s,xxx
...to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death...,s,s,exc
"Look at this, my hairs are standing up my arm. I'm giving myself goose bumps.",c,c,exc
That's the wind.,s,o,neu
"Well, so?  What do you think?",q,q,exc
About what?,q,q,xxx
About what I was saying.,ans,ans,xxx
I think it's ridiculous.,o,o,fru
It certainly is not.  It's like slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,dag,dag,xxx
It's a PR.,o,o,fru
Somebody sold you a bill of goods that something amazing is going to happen on the beach.,o,o,xxx
"It's not just me, okay?  Look at like all the people.",dag,dag,fru
They're all told the same thing.,s,o,fru
"Everybody is believes that it keeps them excited, you know it keeps them coming back for more.",o,o,fru
"Everybody keeps thinking that they can just find the right spot, you know they'll get it on the action.",o,o,fru
Their life will start then.,o,o,fru
Are we talking about the same thing?,q,q,xxx
I'm sorry it still just fish to me.,ans,ans,fru
Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period?,q,q,neu
"Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.",ans,ans,ang
"Okay, well then what's bugging you?",q,q,xxx
"I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.",ans,ans,ang
"Is not supposed to like anything.  We come down here, we look at the fish, they arrive, we go woo-ah fish.",s,s,fru
"Oh. Grow up Augie, the fish are not going to come.",o,o,fru
And then we go home and they go home.,s,s,xxx
Why not?,q,q,fru
"Because they never do.  Do they, have they ever?",q,q,ang
We missed them twice.,ans,ans,neu
Twice is every year we've tried that's ever.,s,s,ang
"Okay we'll see them this year, this is a much better spot. Trust me.",o,o,fru
No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus.,dag,dag,ang
"I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show.",s,s,ang
"Okay, I'm trying to work this backwards",s,s,fru
You don't understand anything I'm saying.,s,dag,fru
and figure out where we took a turn to the worst thing.,s,s,fru
Of course not.,ag,ag,fru
"I did want to see it I still do, I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it just never is.",o,o,xxx
"Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards here and I'm trying to figure out the exact moment that you took a turn for the worst here, now.",s,s,fru
"you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine.",s,s,neu
"Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the ""the Grunions are running tonight,"" and I said ""okay great, let's go.""",s,s,neu
So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and--,s,s,neu
Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married.,s,s,neu
We thought I was pregnant we had this bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance so we took off our shoes.,s,s,xxx
"While we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me, right into my ears so I could feel them much as hear them.",s,s,xxx
"And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",s,s,sad
"Wait a minute, I've got it.",c,c,neu
"Dancing on the beach barefoot, drinking champagne from the bottle.",s,s,xxx
"It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said ""let's get some champagne"" and I said ""no time to wasting"" or something like that.  That's what it is, right?",q,q,neu
"You want this to be like the other times, right?",q,q,xxx
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,ans,ans,sad
"Oh right sure, of course.",ag,ag,neu
Do you want to dance?,q,q,xxx
No.,ans,ans,sad
You want me to go get some champagne?,q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,sad
Do you want to take off our shoes?,q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,xxx
What? Huh?,q,q,neu
You want to get married again?,q,q,neu
What?  What?  You want to divorce?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,fru
A vacation?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,fru
"A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want?",q,q,ang
I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.,ans,ans,ang
"Well, welcome to the human race.",s,s,fru
You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No.,o,o,ang
"You think there would be times when you'd look at me like I was used Kleenex and then I'd look at you and think ""Holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska.""",o,o,xxx
"No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--",o,o,sad
No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this.,s,s,sad
This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,s,s,ang
"Yeah, it is.",dag,dag,neu
"Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting.",o,o,ang
Right.,ag,ag,neu
This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.,o,o,sad
I know me neither.,ag,ag,sad
This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying?,q,q,sad
I'm doing the best I can.,ans,ans,sad
"I know that Augie, I really do.",ag,ag,sad
"I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else.",o,o,sad
Maybe if you were with somebody else too?,o,o,sad
I didn't say that.,dag,dag,sad
"No, I know but--I know I don't make you happy.",o,o,sad
Are you kidding me?  For heaven sake Augie anything I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.,o,o,sur
Yeah?,q,q,sad
"Yes, don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?",q,q,sur
"You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself.",o,ans,sad
"Actually, you know what?  Now you mentioned that--no I don't.",dag,dag,xxx
So maybe we're in the wrong spot.  But we're with the right person.,o,o,xxx
"I don't know, just seemed like such a good spot to me.",o,o,xxx
We do have really good view of the moon from here though.,o,o,xxx
Oh I saw that.  Pretty isn't it. Big ol' white moon.,o,o,xxx
Look what we got here.,s,s,hap
"Augie, you brought refreshments.",s,s,xxx
It's not champagne.,s,s,neu
I guess we don't need glasses.,s,s,hap
"Are you cold, huh?  Do you want to go home?",q,q,neu
I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this might be the spot after all.,ans,ans,hap
"Augie, I'm sorry.",ap,ap,sad
Shh...,b,oth,hap

Presents? It was a trivial little broach.,s,s,sur
It was bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.,s,s,xxx
Not at all. It was very pretty. I still wear it often.,dag,dag,xxx
You sent out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,s,s,xxx

I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses.,s,s,ang
"Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses.",s,s,neu
I just think it's silly you know to go on and on and on about such a thing.,o,o,xxx
You can hardly call three glasses of liquor in a whole evening going on and on and on.,o,o,xxx
"I just, I just think it's becoming a habit with you.",o,o,xxx
"Hmm.  Well, you needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment, okay?",q,q,xxx
Do be quiet.,c,c,xxx
"Really, Amanda.",dag,dag,fru
"Don't be stupid, what?",o,q,ang
Nothing.,ans,ans,fru
Are you going out somewhere dear?,q,q,neu
"No, darling I'm just making myself fascinating for you.",ans,ans,xxx
That reply has broken my heart.,s,s,xxx
Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you?,o,o,ang
As matter the fact that's perfectly true.,ag,ag,xxx
"Oh no, it isn't.",dag,dag,xxx
"Yes, it is.",dag,dag,xxx
"Don't be stupid, shut up.",c,c,xxx
"You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable.",o,o,ang
"Oh, well that's funny.  It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.",o,o,xxx
"You know what?  You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder.",o,o,ang
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",dag,dag,xxx
Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap.,dag,dag,ang
They sting.,dag,dag,ang

Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,q,q,ang
"Yes, I did quite a lot.",ans,ans,ang
I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too.,o,o,ang
"Oh, mind you own business.",c,c,ang
"I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh?  No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how.",o,o,ang
"You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk.",o,o,ang
I am not in the least bit drunk.,dag,dag,ang
You always had a weak head.,o,o,ang
I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.,o,o,ang
"On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",o,o,ang
"Oh very, very interesting Amanda.  How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know?  Intemperate tots.",o,o,ang
Shut up.,c,c,ang
Not very funny darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy?,q,q,ang
That's a very good idea I think I will.,ans,ans,ang
Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs.,c,c,ang
Why?,q,q,ang
There are no people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.,s,ans,xxx
Well then you'll wake the people downstairs.,q,q,ang
They are away in Tunis.,ans,ans,ang
This is no time a year for Tunis.,o,o,ang
"Turn it on again, please.",c,c,ang
I will do no such thing.,dag,s,ang
Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,dag,dag,ang
Turn it off. It's driving me mad.,c,c,ang
I won't.,dag,dag,ang
Turn it off.,c,c,ang
Stop it. No. Go away.,c,c,ang
Amanda listen. Listen.,c,c,ang
"listen Oh I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.",o,o,ang
That's very amusing indeed.,dag,dag,ang
"Oh you're cruel you're...you're...I hate you, I hate you. Go away. You're conceited. You're overbearing. You're utterly impossible.",o,o,ang
"You...You're an evil minded, self-centered little wench and I never want to see you again.",o,o,ang
This is the end do you hear me?  Finally and forever.,s,s,ang
You're not going like this.,c,c,ang
"Oh yes I am...Oh yes I am. Let go of me. You let go. You...urgh...You're a cruel friend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again...Ha...Never, never, never, never. I hope you die in torment. You beast.",o,o,ang
No you're not.,dag,dag,ang
Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live.,o,o,ang

I have my passport and I have my driver's license. And that's all I have.,ans,s,fru

I can't.,ans,ans,fru
And I can give you my social--,s,s,fru

"Well, why didn't the D.M.V. put that you needed your birth certificate on the application then?",q,q,ang
"I--when you're going to the D.M.V., you usually need pretty professional identification--",ans,ans,fru
"You know, Official documentation--",s,s,ang
"Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate?  Nobody does that.",o,o,ang
"No, but you come--you come to the D.M.V., it's something-- You should've- You should've figured--",dag,dag,fru
With your driver's license and your passport.  Just like everybody else.,s,s,ang
"But, without your drive--where-where- what about your identification without your driver's license?  I mean, you need--you needed something before then?",q,q,fru
"Who--you always use your driver's license.  I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway.",ans,ans,ang
"All right.  Well, um, you know, I'd love to help you, but--nothing I can do.",s,s,fru
"So, if you wanna go get your birth certificate, um, maybe come back--I don't--maybe you can talk to the person in the--in the front of line maybe.  I don't know.",o,o,fru
Do you have a supervisor?,q,q,fru

You could send me pictures.,o,o,sad

"You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us.  So so, really, it's really the risk was taken and, I'm sorry, but there's really nothing else we can do.  So do you want--do you want the reimbursement?",s,s,neu
"[BREATHING] Well, sure, yeah, I guess I'll go buy dinner and then be--have nothing for the rest of my entire vacation.  I'm supposed to be here for three weeks.  What am I gonna do without anything for three weeks?",q,q,fru

"Yeah, I'm sure you -- You're like, hmm, do you take baggage?  No.  Oh, okay, thanks.  Great.  I mean how--",s,s,fru
but Unfortunately sometimes is--,s,s,neu
"Well, that's--that's what I'm saying--",s,s,neu
There needs to be better security here.,o,o,fru
"Okay.  Well that that could be something that you put on on the claim--on on the complaint form if you want.  And provide us with your information while you're here and then, maybe, if it turns up, then we'll send it right over.",o,o,neu
It sounds like it's such a little like oh well no big deal whatever.  It's a big deal to me.,s,s,ang
"All right, Miss, I-I know.  I realize this. But Like I said, there are several people that are in your same situation, so, um, it's not--it's not totally uncommon and I'm actually gonna have to ask you to move so I can help the next person.",s,s,neu

You start to lose like that image after a while.,o,o,sad
"That will be, It'll be--it'll be better that way. I mean Time will tell.  Time heals, you know, and it's good.  It's okay.  I mean, it wasn't anybody's fault or anything like that so .",o,o,neu

"Well, yeah, I mean I heard there was like these package deals and that maybe I could get a like a hotel or something like that. and-",s,s,fru
"Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You know, and especially because you've been waiting so long and I know that, um, you've been having a difficult time.",ag,ag,neu
"I want to definitely give you our special package today, which um is usually only for valued customers who have a record of having previous,",s,s,neu
"um lots of purchases, but we're gonna go ahead and give that to you anyway. uh,  Just to make sure that you're happy with your service here.",s,s,neu
You- You can do that--You can do that now? I don't have to get like transferred through or anything like that.,s,q,neu
Is that all right?,q,q,neu
"I can do that right now for you. No, absolutely.  I can take care of you all the way through to the end.",ans,ans,neu

"um, you're scheduling a flight as well--And you would like to, um, we have a highly discounted hotel rate that goes along with that so that everything is all in one deal.  You're taken care of by the time that you get there.",s,s,neu
"All right.  I want to make sure it's like a nice hotel--I mean-mean I'm gonna be paying a lot of money for this so I don't wanna-I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna to be a waste of time.",s,s,neu
Absolutely. we we,ag,ag,neu
"Yes, I completely understand.  Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above.  Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves.",s,s,neu
"So, you will absolutely be in a high rated great hotel and we can make sure that it's in a area of town that you like as well.",s,s,neu
Okay. So--,b,b,neu
Yeah.,ag,b,neu
"Well, you know, we wanted to--we wanted to go to Maui and--That was a",s,s,neu

"All right, Sure.  A yeah, that- that'd be good.",ans,ans,xxx
Okay.  Great.  What time of the day would you like?,q,q,neu
"Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know--",ans,ans,neu
All right.  Great.  Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that.,s,s,neu
"So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui.",s,s,neu
"And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel.",q,q,neu
Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare.,ans,ans,neu
And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel.,s,s,neu

He saw it.,s,s,xxx
"How could he see it?  I was the first one up, he was still in bed.",q,q,xxx
He was out here when it broke.,ans,ans,xxx
When?,q,q,xxx
About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.,ans,ans,xxx
What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,q,q,xxx
"I don't know.  When it cracked, he ran back in the house and cried in the kitchen.",ans,ans,xxx
Did you talk to him?,q,q,sad
No.  I thought it was best to leave him alone.,ans,ans,xxx
He cried hard?,q,q,sad
What was he doing out here at that hour?,q,q,sad
He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.,ans,ans,xxx
He's getting just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that?,q,q,xxx
"I don't know the meaning of it.  But, I know one thing Mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.",ans,ans,xxx
What?,q,q,xxx
"Being dishonest with him.  I mean, that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.",ans,ans,xxx
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,q,q,xxx
What do you want to do argue with him?,q,q,fru
"No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore?",ans,ans,xxx
Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now?,q,q,ang
You can't say that to him.,ans,ans,fru
We've got to say it to him.,c,c,fru
Can you prove it?  How can you prove it?,q,q,fru
"For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.",ans,ans,ang
"To you it is and to me, but not to him.  I mean, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but he--there's no body and no grave so where are you?",q,q,fru
"Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.",c,c,xxx
"Trouble is the God damn newspapers.  Every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere so, you know, the next one is gonna be Larry.",s,s,xxx
All right.  All right.  Listen to me.  You know why I brought Annie here don't you?,q,q,fru
Why?,q,q,xxx
You know.,ans,ans,xxx
"I've got an idea, but what's the story?",q,q,sad
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, that's only your business, Chris.",o,o,neu
You know it's not only my business.,dag,dag,fru
What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,o,o,ang
So it's all right then?,q,q,fru
I'll go ahead with it?,q,q,fru
"Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't going to--",ans,s,xxx
"Well, then it isn't just my business--",s,s,ang
I'm just saying that--,s,s,neu
"Ah, sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  I mean, isn't it your business too if I tell Dad and flips--freaks out about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",o,o,xxx
I ignore what I gotta ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.,s,s,xxx
She's not Larry's girl.,dag,dag,ang
"From your father's point of view, he isn't dead.  And you've no right to take his girl.",s,s,fru
"And you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?",q,q,fru
"I don't know why, but, every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer.  My whole bloody life.  Time after time after time.",o,o,fru
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.,o,o,neu
To hell with that.,dag,dag,ang
[BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet?,q,q,neu
I wanted to get this settled first.,ans,ans,xxx
"Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.",q,q,neu
"Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",ans,ans,sad
"Trouble is, you don't see enough women.",o,o,sad
You never did.,s,s,fru
"So what, I'm not fast with women.",ag,ag,xxx
I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,s,s,fru
Because it is.,s,s,neu
"Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.  I mean, you've been away for--at war.  It's been five years.",s,s,fru
"I can't help it.  I know her best.  I mean, I grew up next door to her.",s,s,xxx
"These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",q,q,fru
"I don't want a diagram.  Umm-- He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.",ans,ans,fru
"I mean, what's gonna happen to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.",q,q,fru
"All right.  All right, then, Mom.",a,a,fru
I just--give it some more thought.,c,c,fru
I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,s,s,fru
"But if I can't--if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.",s,s,xxx
What the hell is this?,q,q,sur
I'll get out.  I'll get married and go live some place else.  Maybe New York.,ans,ans,xxx
Are you crazy?,q,q,ang
I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.,ans,ans,ang
What about the business?  What the hell is this?,q,q,ang
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ans,ans,ang
Must you be inspired?,q,q,ang
"Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.",ans,ans,ang
"I want a family.  I want kids.  I want something that I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now, where do I find it?",s,s,xxx
"Tell me, you'd leave the business?",q,q,xxx
"Yes, on this I would.",ans,ans,neu
"Well, you don't want to think like that.",c,o,ang
Then help me stay here.,c,c,xxx
"All right, but just don't go thinkin' like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for?  I mean, the whole thing is for you, Chris.  The whole shootin' match is for you.",s,s,xxx
"I know.  I know, Mom.  Just help me stay here.",ag,ag,fru
"All right.  Just-- just don't go thinkin' that way, you hear me?",q,q,fru
I am thinkin' that way.,ans,ans,neu
"I don't understand you, do I?",q,q,fru
"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",ans,ans,neu
I can see that.,ag,s,sad
She's been in New York for three and half years.  Why all of a sudden?,q,q,xxx
"Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.",ans,ans,neu
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,o,s,xxx
What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again?,q,q,neu
Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.,c,c,xxx
She's not-,b,b,xxx
How do you know he's even thinking of it?,q,q,neu
-he's not gonna marry her.,c,c,oth
It's got that all about it.,ans,ans,ang
"Well, so what?",q,q,neu
"What's going on here, Joe?",q,q,xxx
"Now, listen Kate.",c,c,neu
"She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",o,o,xxx
You can't read her mind.,o,o,neu
"Well then why is she still single?  I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited.",o,o,fru
How do you know why she's waited?,q,q,neu
"She knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",ans,ans,fru
"Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?",q,q,fru
"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe?  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",o,o,xxx
"Well, what do you want me to do about it?",q,q,fru
I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.,ans,ans,fru
But Kate--,b,b,fru
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but...",o,o,ang
But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.,s,s,ang
Calm yourself.,c,c,fru
"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone.",s,s,fru
Calm yourself.,c,c,fru
"Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  I mean, you read it yourself.",s,s,fru
All right.  All right.  Calm yourself.,c,c,fru
"You, above all, have to believe.",c,c,fru
What?- Why- Why me above all?,q,q,xxx
Just--just don't stop believing.,ans,ans,fru
What does that mean?  Me above all?,q,q,ang
Look at you.  Look at you shaking.,s,s,ang
I can't help it.,o,o,fru
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?,q,q,ang
It's all right.  It's a good thing.,ans,ans,xxx
"You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.",o,o,xxx
Why?,q,q,xxx
"Well, for one thing, your mother as much as told me to go.",ans,ans,xxx
Oh.,b,b,xxx
"You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um--",s,s,xxx
What?,q,q,xxx
"Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.",ans,ans,xxx
"The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But, they take it for granted that we're all set.",s,s,xxx
"I knew they would, your mother anyway.",ag,ag,xxx
"Well,",b,b,xxx
"from her point of view, why else would I come?",ans,q,sad
"Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know, this is why I asked you to come.",ans,ans,xxx
I--I guess this is why I came.,o,o,xxx
"Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",o,o,xxx
I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.,s,s,xxx
I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.,o,s,xxx
"You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.",o,o,exc
"Oh, Chris, I've been ready for a long, long time.",s,s,xxx
And he's gone forever.  You're sure?,q,q,xxx
I almost got married two years ago.,ans,ans,hap
Why didn't you?,q,q,xxx
You started to write me and--,ans,ans,hap
You felt something that far back?,q,q,xxx
Every day since.,ans,ans,hap
"Anne, why didn't you let me know?",q,q,xxx
"Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, I mean, what did you say?  You can sure be ambiguous sometimes.",ans,ans,xxx
"Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a-",c,c,xxx
"oh God, I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",o,o,xxx
I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,s,o,hap
"Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm gonna make you so happy.",o,o,xxx
Not like that you're not.,o,o,xxx
I kissed you.,s,s,xxx
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it?",q,q,xxx
Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.,s,s,xxx
"No.  What is it, your mother?",q,q,xxx
No.  Nothing like that.,ans,ans,sad
"Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",q,q,sad
"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",ans,ans,sad
You've gotta tell me.,c,c,sad
I don't know how to start.,s,s,sad
It wouldn't work this way.,s,s,sad
"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",q,q,sad
"Yeah, sure.",ans,ans,sad
"Well, I lost them.",s,s,sad
How many?,q,q,sad
Just about all.,ans,ans,sad
"Oh, gee.",b,b,sad
It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.,o,o,sad
"For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",s,s,sad
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",o,o,sad
"I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.",o,o,sad
"You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",o,o,sad
Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.,s,s,sad
"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",s,s,sad
"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",o,o,sad
Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.,o,o,sad
You still feel that way?,q,q,sad
I want you now Annie.,ans,ans,xxx
"Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything that you have.  Do you understand that?  Everything, Chris, and me too.",o,o,xxx
"I mean, and your money, there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.",o,o,xxx
"I know Annie.  Annie, I'm gonna make a fortune for you.",ag,ag,xxx
What'll I do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.,q,q,exc
"This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better.",o,o,exc
"I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.",o,o,exc
How you doing?,q,q,exc
Fine.,ans,ans,xxx
Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell.,s,s,exc
"Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think?",q,q,exc
"How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.",s,s,exc
What flashlight?,q,q,neu
"You know, the flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?",ans,ans,xxx
That's not your flashlight.,s,s,xxx
Who's is it?,q,q,xxx
It's ours.  It's mine too.,ans,ans,xxx
"Oh, well sure.",ag,ag,neu
"You kept saying my flashlight, if as if somehow it's just yours.  I mean is that supposed to make me feel?",q,q,xxx
"Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally.",ag,ag,neu
How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.,o,o,xxx
"I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember?",q,q,neu
Yeah.,ag,ans,neu
"You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh, we should've brought the blanket.  Our blanket.",s,s,neu
"This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now.",s,s,exc
I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.,o,o,exc
You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,q,q,exc
I'm cold.,s,s,xxx
Do you want my jacket?,q,q,neu
"It's after eleven, let's just go home.",s,s,fru
Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home.,q,q,xxx
There is no point in coming down here.,ans,ans,xxx
Right.,ag,b,neu
That's my point.,s,s,xxx
That's my point too.,ag,ag,neu
"So, let's go.",c,c,xxx
No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?,dag,dag,neu
Not particularly.,ans,ans,xxx
Why not?,q,q,xxx
I just don't.  It's stupid.,ans,ans,xxx
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year, you know.",s,s,xxx
"Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.",s,s,exc
"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die.",s,s,fru
"Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,",s,s,exc
this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.,o,o,exc
"What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.",o,o,fru
Yeah they do.,dag,dag,fru
"Ah, Augie.",b,b,fru
Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.,s,s,exc
There's--there's a bit of the magic--some unexplainable here.  I don't see how you can not be interested.,o,o,xxx
I'm just not.,s,s,fru
For real?,q,q,xxx
Yeah.,ag,ans,xxx
"I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life.",s,s,neu
"And last year, I remember specifically you were so excited to go that you stubbed your toe rushing me out of the house and didn't even notice until we got in the car.",s,s,xxx
"Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions.",s,s,fru
We weren't in a good spot.,o,o,neu
We didn't see them the first time either.,s,s,neu
"We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  Believe me, I've got good instincts for these things.",o,o,xxx
There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?,q,q,exc
"Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this.",c,c,exc
"Somewhere out there, this huge mass of silver fish swimming this way.",s,s,xxx
"They don't know why, we don't know why.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map, it wasn't a decision, just-",s,s,xxx
"all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters.",s,s,exc
It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name.,o,o,exc
"They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.",s,s,exc
"Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up.",s,s,exc
That's the wind.,s,s,xxx
"Well, so what do you think?",q,q,neu
About what?,q,q,neu
What I was saying.,ans,ans,neu
It's ridiculous.,o,o,xxx
"Well, so what do you think?",q,q,exc
About what?,q,q,neu
What I was saying.,ans,ans,neu
It's ridiculous.,o,o,fru
It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,dag,dag,neu
It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is gonna take place on the beach.,o,o,xxx
"Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.",dag,dag,neu
"Sure, everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all excited.  It keeps us coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start any second now if we could just find the right spot and get in on the action.",o,o,xxx
Are we talking about the same thing?,q,q,xxx
"Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me.",ans,ans,xxx
"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?",q,q,neu
"God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.",ans,ans,ang
"Well, what's bugging you?",q,q,fru
We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.,ans,ans,ang
"There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home.",s,s,neu
"For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions.",o,o,fru
Why not?,q,q,fru
"We never do, do we?  I mean, have we ever?",q,q,fru
We've missed them twice.  That's not ever.,ans,ans,neu
Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.,s,s,fru
"Well, we'll see them this year.",o,o,neu
"No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.",dag,dag,fru
"I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.",o,o,ang
I thought you wanted to see it.,o,o,fru
You don't understand anything I'm saying.,s,s,fru
"No, of course not.",dag,dag,fru
I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is.,o,o,fru
It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about.,o,o,neu
"For heaven sake, this isn't about fish.",s,s,xxx
"All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst.",s,s,fru
"I mean, you were-  you were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see.  I took a shower.  You watched the news.",s,s,xxx
"You said, ""Hey the grunion are running tonight.""  I said, ""Great, let's go.  I feel lucky.""",s,s,neu
"Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--",s,s,neu
"Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married.",s,s,sad
"I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",s,s,sad
"And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.",s,s,sad
"And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",s,s,sad
Wait a minute.  I've got it.,c,c,neu
"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",s,s,sad
"It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, ""let's get some champagne,"" and I said, ""time's a wasting"" or something like that, right?",q,q,neu
"Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right?",q,q,neu
I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.,ans,ans,sad
"Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance?",q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,sad
You want me to go get some champagne?,q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,sad
Take off our shoes?,q,q,neu
No. No.,ans,ans,xxx
"Well, what?  You want me to breathe in your ear?",q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,sad
You wanna get married again?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,fru
What?  What?  You want a divorce?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,fru
A vacation?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,fru
"A new carpet?  A poodle?  Ice cream?  Back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What?  Carla, what the hell do you want?",q,q,fru
I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.,ans,ans,xxx
"Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?",q,q,ang
"No.  You think I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like a used Kleenex?  Or that I'd look at you and think, holy hell, when's the next flight to Alaska?",s,s,xxx
"No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us",o,o,sad
"cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",s,s,fru
This.  What?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,s,s,xxx
"Yes, it is.",dag,dag,neu
"Uh, right this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",o,o,xxx
Right.,ag,ag,neu
Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,o,o,sad
"I know, me neither.",ag,ag,sad
"I mean, this is just this.  It includes a lot and everything, but it isn't something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",q,q,xxx
I'm doing the best I can.,ans,ans,sad
"I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.",ag,ag,sad
"I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",o,o,sad
Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,o,o,sad
I didn't say that.,dag,dag,sad
"No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.",ag,ag,sad
"Oh, for heaven sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",o,o,xxx
Yeah?,q,q,sur
"Oh, don't be ridiculous.  I mean, don't you know that?",q,q,xxx
You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.,o,o,sad
"Well, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.",dag,dag,xxx
"Okay.  Fine so.  We're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.",o,o,xxx
"I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here.",o,o,hap
"Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.",o,o,xxx
"Well, look what we have here.",s,s,hap
"Augie, you brought refreshments.",s,s,hap
It's not champagne.,s,s,hap
"Well, then we don't need glasses.",s,s,hap
You still cold?  Do you wanna go home?,q,q,xxx
No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all.,ans,ans,hap
"Augie, I'm sorry.",ap,ap,sad
Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.,o,o,hap
Or not.,o,o,hap
Or not.,o,ag,hap
Good God.,s,s,xxx
Do you think it's them?,q,q,fea
I wonder.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, nobody know we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",s,s,fea
"Must be them, then.",o,s,xxx
What're we gonna do?,q,q,fea
"We're all right, darling, aren't we?  Whatever happens.",s,s,xxx
"Now and always, sweet.",ag,ag,xxx
I don't care then.,s,s,neu
It was bound to come sooner or later.,s,s,xxx
Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.,s,s,neu
"Ah, it send shivers up my spine.",s,s,exc
What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,q,q,xxx
Behave exquisitely.,ans,ans,hap
With the most perfect poise?,q,q,neu
"Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy.",ans,ans,hap
Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?,q,q,neu
What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,ans,ans,hap
"Oh, darling, don't say that.",c,c,neu
It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.,o,o,hap
"Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",q,q,neu
"Yes, meaning just that.",ans,ans,hap
"Oh, what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",q,q,xxx
Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,c,c,xxx
"You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want.",o,o,neu
Who's they?,q,q,neu
All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.,ans,ans,neu
Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,o,o,neu
"If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.",o,o,neu
"Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright.",ag,ag,neu
"Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours.",q,q,neu
Who knows.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?",q,q,neu
"No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion.",ans,ans,neu
"Oh, dear, shall we like that?",q,q,neu
Depends on how well we've played.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh?",q,q,neu
Yes.  Yes. With all his might.,ans,ans,exc
"That's serious enough, isn't it?",q,q,xxx
"No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.",ans,ans,exc
"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",o,o,hap
So is everyone else in the long run.,o,o,neu
"Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment.",o,o,exc
"Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",o,o,exc
"Elliott, worms don't pop.",s,s,hap
"I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best.",o,o,neu
"Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",o,o,hap
You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,q,q,neu
Which particular one?,q,q,hap
The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.,ans,ans,neu
Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully.,s,s,hap
"Ah, horrible thing.  I hated it.",o,o,xxx
"Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.",ag,ag,hap
How long did that row last?,q,q,neu
It went in intermittently for days.,ans,ans,hap
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.,s,s,neu
It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,s,s,hap
"That was a rouser, wasn't it?",q,q,xxx
That was the first time you ever hit me.,ans,ans,neu
I didn't hit you very hard.,o,o,neu
"The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.",s,s,hap
"Oh, I'll never forget his face.",s,s,exc
It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.,o,o,exc
We were very much younger then.,s,s,neu
and very much sillier,o,o,xxx
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",s,s,neu
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,s,s,neu
Presents?  Just a trivial little broach.,s,s,xxx
"Ah, yes, I remember it well.  Bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.",s,s,xxx
"No, it wasn't.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.",dag,dag,xxx
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,s,s,xxx
"No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.",dag,dag,xxx
"You must admit, he was in love with you, wasn't he?",q,q,xxx
"Just a little perhaps, nothing serious.",ans,ans,xxx
You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,s,s,xxx
"Well, what of it?",q,q,xxx
What of it?,b,b,ang
It didn't hurt him at all and I enjoyed it.,o,s,xxx
"Well, what about me?",q,q,ang
"Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",ans,ans,neu
"Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",o,o,xxx
I'm bored with this conversation.,o,o,xxx
"Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy?",q,q,neu
"No, thanks.",ans,ans,xxx
I think I'll have some.,s,s,xxx
Don't see why you want any.  You've already had two glasses.,s,s,xxx
No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.,s,s,neu
Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,o,o,neu
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.,o,o,fru
"Well, it's become a habit with you.",o,o,neu
"You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.",o,o,ang
Don't be so stupid.,o,o,ang
"Really, Amanda.",dag,dag,xxx
What?,q,q,ang
Nothing.,ans,ans,fru
Going out somewhere dear?,q,q,xxx
"No, just making myself fascinating for you.",ans,ans,xxx
That reply has broken my heart.,s,s,xxx
"A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?",o,o,exc
"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",ag,ag,xxx

"Ah, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.",o,o,xxx
Doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,o,o,fru
"Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",o,o,fru
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",dag,dag,ang
Nonsense.  They have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,dag,dag,fru

Mind your own business.,c,c,fru

Shut up.,c,c,ang

All right.  I will.,ag,ag,xxx
"You better turn that off, I think.",o,o,xxx
Why?,q,q,ang
Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs.,ans,ans,fru
There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,s,s,fru
There are people downstairs I suppose?,q,q,fru
They're away in Tunis.,ans,ans,xxx

Shut up. Shut up.,c,c,ang
I wouldn't-- I wouldn't marry--,s,s,ang
I wouldn't marry you if you came in crawling on your knees,o,o,ang
Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it.,o,o,ang
You're a evil vampire and I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.,o,o,ang

"I actually need two forms of ID. I need either a passport or a birth certificate, or social security card. I'm sorry.",s,s,neu
"Uh, sorry, I forgot them. I mean I've got to -",ap,ap,neu
Well,b,b,neu
well is the dri-driver's license going to work?,q,q,neu
I- I can take your driver's license but I need another form of ID in order to process this paper work.,s,s,neu
"Okay, so what are you saying? What-",q,q,fru
"Um, that you would need to go home and get another form of ID and come back.",ans,ans,neu
"What? I- You telling me I waited in that huge line to go and sit down and get my number called, like after",s,s,ang
"Well, I'm sorry sir but",ap,ap,fru
three hours and,s,s,ang
you need to bring two forms of ID there is nothing we can do about it.,s,s,fru
Shouldn't they have like told us about that? I mean why - why would they make me go and wait three hours if I have got to go and do it again?,q,q,ang
"Well, it's actually-",s,s,fru
"It's standard that you bring a couple of forms of ID, I'm sorry.",ap,s,fru
"It's standard? I mean I don't work at the D.M.V. how am I supposed to know that, like, I stand in line, I get my",q,q,ang
"Well, I'm sorry, sir, but we're not responsible.",ap,ap,fru
"I filled out the application right, didn't I?",q,q,ang
"Yes, you did, thank you very much, but we're not responsible if you've forgotten something, and we need to have two forms of ID.",ans,ans,fru
Okay. What about - no -- how about you hold that and I'll - I'll go and I can come back-,q,q,fru
"I'm sorry, but there is a lot of people waiting so you're just going to have to get in line again.",ap,ap,fru
I've been waiting for three hours.,s,s,fru
"It just happens to people all the time, I'm sorry sir, but I can't make an exception for you.",s,s,fru
This is ridiculous. Come on,o,o,fru
"I'm sorry, sir.",ap,ap,neu
"I cannot go back in that line. I've got stuff I need to do, I mean-",s,s,fru
there is nothing I can do.,s,s,neu
"But my driver's license - I had to have my birth certificate to get my driver's license in the first place right, I mean this - here is my driver's license so",s,s,xxx
"I know sir, but we have to have two forms. There is nothing I can do about it, I'm sorry.",s,s,fru
That doesn't make any sense. Why?,q,q,fru
"I'm sorry, sir. There is nothing I can do.",ap,ap,fru
You- shouldn't you have like a sign or something maybe like up on the counter when you get the applica- maybe on the application,s,s,ang
"Well, if you had checked the web site it would have said.",s,s,fru
If you had checked the website it would have said that you needed two forms of identification.,s,s,fru
"What web- I didn't go to a website - why would I need to - it's the D.M.V.. You come to the D.M.V., you wait in line for three hours, and then you go home.",ans,s,ang
"Well, maybe you should",o,o,fru
I waited in line now I'm ready to get my stuff and then go home.,s,s,fru
Right. So maybe you should go home now and get your paperwork and come back.,o,s,fru
"I'm sorry sir but there's a lot of people waiting. So if you won't move out of the way, then I'm going to have to call security.",ap,ap,fru
"God, oh my-",b,b,fru
This is ridiculous.,o,o,fru
"I'm sorry, sir, it's not my choice.",ap,ap,fru
"I'm going to miss you too; I don't know what I'm going to do here without you. It's going to be so lonely, and so hard.",o,o,sad
I don't want to be a single mom.,o,o,sad
"You won't be. I'll be back; I'll be back before you know it. All right, and",dag,dag,sad
but,b,b,sad
and,b,b,sad
It's dangerous; I mean how can you make sure that you'll,o,o,sad
"It's- It's dangerous anywhere, honey. I mean this is -this- I'm just going to go and we'll get it over with,",s,s,fru

"No, it doesn't work that way",ans,ans,xxx
"but, I mean, I'm going to do whatever I can and get back here as fast as I can.",o,o,xxx
It doesn't make any sense; I don't know why we have to be at war in the first place.,o,o,fru
"I know, but it's not our decision, I guess, you know, I mean",o,o,xxx
there's people that thought it was the right thing to do so now we have to- we have to do what we have to do for our country,s,s,sad
"and it'll work out you know, go there and do that. Yeah, I'll be back",s,s,neu
"Will you write me letters, paper ones?",q,q,sad
"Yeah, of course. I don't know if we'll have computers or anything like that you know, so probably my only option then.",ans,ans,xxx
"Yeah, I'll write you every day 'cause you're the only thing that's going to be on my mind.",o,o,xxx

"Oh, my Gosh. Well, and did",b,b,exc
"I'm so nervous you know, I'm-",s,s,xxx
Did she say yes?,q,q,exc
"Yes, she said yes. [LAUGHTER] I know",ans,ans,exc
That's like the most definitive.,o,o,exc
"Oh, my gosh, wait so when did you decide to do this, I mean,",q,q,xxx
I would have thought you would have told me that you were planning on doing this.,o,o,exc
"Yea, I guess so. Oh, my Gosh. Was she surprised?",q,q,exc
"Yes, yes. You know, she - she was like - I mean, she was happy, you know",ans,ans,exc
Yeah.,ag,ag,xxx
"I - I think it was about time, I don't know, maybe. You know what, it's been it's been long enough now.",o,o,exc
So what did you do?,q,q,xxx
"Oh, well, it was -- you know, we were at this- at this concert and yeah",ans,ans,hap
so I-I talked to some of the crew before hand and-,s,s,hap
"Oh, You did not.",dag,a,exc
I-I did.,s,s,hap
"Oh, my Gosh. that's so cute",o,o,exc
"So I got the band to do something, you know, like towards the end of the song I got to go up on stage and, uh",s,s,xxx
"That's so romantic. Oh, my Gosh. She must have died. That's like one of those things you write into a magazine about like my boyfriend did this. Oh my God.",o,o,exc
"I know, so",ag,ag,hap
I got to freak her out.,s,s,hap
"No, yes -- so",ans,b,exc
She must have flipped out.,q,q,exc
"Yea, that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no.",ans,ans,hap
Right exactly because you can't say no in front of thousands of people. [LAUGHTER],ag,ag,exc
"No, but it was good.",o,o,exc
Did you bring her up on stage too?,q,q,exc
"Yes, yes. [LAUGHTER]",ans,ans,exc
"Oh, my Gosh, that's so cute.",o,o,exc
"I know it was, I don't know I was really nervous but I'm really - I'm really glad.",o,o,exc
Are your parents excited or...?,q,q,exc
"Oh yes, they - they you know they love her and so I mean...",ans,ans,hap
"Yea, totally. So when is it going to happen?",q,q,xxx
"Well, we're thinking uh - we're thinking winter time, you know, we're going to do it in the winter and then maybe, you know, maybe",ans,ans,xxx
"I don't know either do a honeymoon like in the snow or fly down to like Australia, Southern Hemisphere, [GARBAGE] so we'll decide with that.",ans,o,xxx
"Ooh, that would be fun.",o,o,exc
"Do you think you'll get a house or something, like you guys are looking to buy some place or",q,q,xxx
"Yea, yea, I'm not too sure where yet I guess you know, I kind of got to figure some stuff out here first",ans,ans,exc
Yeah. [LAUGHTER],ag,ag,xxx
but like you know it's just - I guess we're just excited right now that we'll get to continue it together.,o,o,xxx
"Oh my Gosh. I cannot believe you're getting married, that is so cool.",o,o,exc
I know.,ag,ag,exc
"Golly, it just makes me all like romantic inside, like I really want that to happen to me. [LAUGHTER]",o,o,exc
"Oh, it will, obviously you know. But I know it's something - I don't know, you never really think about it happening, like before hand.",ans,ag,hap
Did you have a good ring? You better have had a good ring.,q,q,xxx
"Sure. Oh, yes.",ag,ans,hap
Good. The ring makes all the difference.,o,o,xxx
You know I had my mom come along maybe help me out a little bit because she's got good taste. but,o,o,xxx
"Oh, that's awesome.",o,o,xxx

"Yay, well congratulations, that's so cool. [BREATHING] I can't wait.",o,a,exc
Hah.,b,oth,hap
I don't know what I'm going to do about this; I mean,ans,ans,fru
"I have got to get a job, you know? Like-",o,s,fru
"You've been doing a lot of work for it, right?",q,q,neu
"Well, yea you know, I get my resumes and I mean I-",ans,ans,fru
"Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is -",o,o,neu
"I go out all the places I can, every place that'll give an interview you know.",s,s,fru
"you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can.",o,o,neu
"But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, or",o,o,fru
"Well, but you care about what you do, right?",q,q,neu
"I don't know, I mean why - why",q,q,fru
"Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know.",o,ans,fru
"I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh",o,o,neu
"Well, and that's what I begin to question after a while is maybe I just don't want it, maybe it's not even worth it, you know, like",o,o,xxx
"I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know.",o,o,fru
"Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself.",o,o,neu
"Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else.",s,o,fru
You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's,o,o,neu
"I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table.",dag,dag,fru
"Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time.",o,o,neu
"I mean, maybe I'm not, you know. I don't have a job. Maybe - maybe I'm not as good as-as I thought I was and",o,o,fru
I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and,s,s,fru
I'm sorry.,ap,ap,sad
"I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking",s,s,sad
"maybe - maybe take up painting, I don't know, you know.",o,o,fru
"Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know.",o,o,fru
Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.,o,o,fru
"That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like",o,o,neu
"and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.",o,o,neu
So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.,o,o,neu
"I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn't",o,o,fru
"It might be the latter I don't know because you're not the worst, I mean you're great, you very talented at what you do.",o,o,xxx
this doesn't happen to a normal person.,o,o,ang
"You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.",o,o,neu
"But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.",o,o,neu
"I mean, I don't know, I don't see - I don't see any other way - any other way around it right now.",ans,s,fru
"Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop.",o,o,neu
What am I going to do on a break?,q,q,xxx
"Get out of town or something, I mean you need - you need to clear your head 'cause you seem like you're really frustrated about it. I mean you need to like, be excited about you're doing, rather than, you know upset.",o,ans,xxx
Right. Thanks for talking to me.,a,a,sad
It seems that uh- my-my bag didn't make it out on the carousel.,s,s,neu
"Oh, did you check? Did you make sure as it went around the second time that it-",q,q,neu
"Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so-",s,s,neu
Okay. So what-what do I have to get you know,q,q,neu
"Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-",s,ans,neu
"For some reason, so you think it won't show up?",q,q,sur
"Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that",s,ans,neu
Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.,s,s,neu
What? What? How does that happen?,q,q,xxx
"Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something.",ans,ans,neu
I really - I really need that bag.,s,s,fru
"I- I- I understand, but um.",ag,ag,neu
there are- I have important things in that bag. I've got,s,s,xxx
Okay,ag,ag,neu
"I mean -- I've been away for a while and- and now I've- I've gifts for- for you know friends and family I mean, I got stuff in the there",s,s,fru
Right.,ag,b,neu
It's worth a lot.,s,s,xxx
"I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-",s,s,neu
"Not going to show - well isn't like - wouldn't it just be at the airport, that, like, if it didn't get on the other plane",o,q,fru
can they check there?,q,q,fru
"Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and",s,ans,neu
on another-,b,b,xxx
"they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that.",s,s,neu
So we'll- what we'll do,s,s,neu
"But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and",o,o,ang
see where it came from originally. I mean it seems like-,o,o,fru
Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you.,ag,ag,neu
Theft?,q,q,xxx
"Um, so.",b,b,neu
"Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with-",q,q,ang
"We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know",ans,ans,neu
I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage.,ap,ap,neu
This is unbelievable. I've got,o,o,fru
you don't realize the stuff that I've got in that - I really need to get the suitcase okay,s,s,ang
"I understand, so-",ag,ag,neu
"so if it's back there or something, if there is something you can do",c,c,fru
"I need you to tell me because I really need to get the bag, okay?",s,c,fru
"all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage",s,s,neu
and we will continue to look for it and because your paper-,s,s,neu
You've already checked? Can you check again? [garbage],q,q,fru
"I've already looked, thank you very much and because we've filled out paperwork if it shows up we will send it to you but otherwise what we can do is reimburse you for fifty dollar.",s,s,fru
Fifty- fifty dollars? Come on you have got to be joking.,s,s,xxx
"Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-",s,s,neu
"Uh huh, yea, lost some of my possessions, yes, so if I lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carry-on",s,s,fru
"that might be like fifty dollars okay, but this - I- [garbage] I had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase.",s,s,fru
The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-,s,s,neu
The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean-,q,q,ang
Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have,ans,ans,neu
"we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-",s,s,neu
I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do,q,q,ang
because this is ridiculous?,o,o,fru
I'm sorry. I don't- I-,ap,ap,xxx
I don't believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh- in which we can reimburse you and that's all we can do and I'm sorry I've done everything I can-,s,s,fru
All right. I'm sick- I'm sick of this all right. I'm sick of you and keep your fifty dollar.,o,o,fru
There's other people waiting-,s,s,fru

"like press nine, press zero, press back to the menu, like I can't get through to what I'm supposed to get through to.",s,s,fru
"pretend like your on a rotary phone, goes straight through to a person.",s,s,neu
"Okay. Oh, that would just make it so much better, 'cause I cannot handle it's just like oh, my God I can't sit here any longer and talk to this lady with this pleasant voice.",o,o,fru
I know they don't tell you that kind of thing.,ag,ag,neu
"Sorry. Okay. Um-, yes",ap,ap,neu

it really freaks me out when I got my bill because it was like I don't -- I didn't spend this. This is not my charge.,s,s,fru
"Yea. All right. Well, let me-let me look it up here for a second. Uh, so i think",s,s,neu

Okay. So is there something I can do to get rid of it?,q,q,xxx
it- it'll work out fine.,o,ans,neu
"Yes, we'll get- we'll get rid of it right now. I mean just we're going to have to have you, um, submit something you know, we're going to have to have you mail something in for us, okay.",s,s,neu

and it'll get taken off um- no problem you know,s,s,neu
Okay.,b,b,xxx
Cause I-I just don't know how someone could have gotten my charge information,s,s,fru
I mean I still have my card.,s,s,xxx
Right. I mean we might,ag,b,neu
Okay.,b,b,neu
So is there any- I mean what if they spend something again?,q,q,fea
"Uh, I mean have you been shopping around on the Internet and stuff? I mean that you gave-",q,q,neu
I did buy one thing on ebay I don't know that might-,ans,ans,neu
"Uh-ha, I mean usually sites are pretty well protected but sometimes I mean information gets out, so",s,s,neu
so it is a little a little hard in that situation if you want -- you know you can -um- we can- we can issue another credit card.,o,o,neu
"Oh, really?",q,q,sur
"Yeah, yeah. Maybe we'll, uh-",ans,ans,neu
"Oh that'll be great 'cause I could just get a new number, would that be okay because that way I don't have to worry about it happening again?",o,o,xxx
it's a different number and everything,ans,s,neu
Yeah. yeah.,ag,ag,neu
"Yes, um but  for- for that- for that charge we will need you to send something in but we can get you processed immediately for this, for this, for this new card. It still goes to the same address, right?",s,s,neu
"Yes, absolutely.",ans,ag,xxx
Okay. All right. Then we'll get it sent out there. And,s,s,neu
Great.,a,a,hap
And you know just I mean be careful in the future if um,s,s,neu
Yeah.,ag,b,hap
if you're ever online or anything like that I mean just make sure it's a secure site and,s,s,neu
"and never you know, give it to anyone out, never even give out your number to any like unreliable company that you haven't heard of or anything like that, all right? Because, um, we want to- we definitely want to help you out, but-",s,s,neu
"Right, right.",ag,ag,neu
"Okay, great.",a,a,neu

Well thank you so much. You've been very helpful. I really appreciate it.,o,o,hap
"Alright Yes, I'm sorry for all the inconvenience but we'll get it taken care of.",ap,ap,neu
[BREATHING] Thank you.,g,g,xxx
Thank you very much bye.,g,g,hap
How could he see it? I was the first one up he was still in bed.,q,q,xxx
He was out here when it broke.,ans,ans,xxx
When?,q,q,xxx
About four this morning. I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.,ans,ans,xxx
What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,q,q,xxx
I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.,ans,ans,sad
So you talked to him?,q,q,xxx
No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.,ans,ans,sad
He cried hard?,q,q,xxx
I could hear him right through the floor in my room.,ans,ans,sad
"What was he doing out here at that hour? He's dreaming about him again, he's walking around at night.",q,q,xxx
I guess he is.,ag,ans,xxx
He's getting just like after he died. What is the meaning of that?,q,q,xxx
"I don't know the meaning of it, but I know one thing mom, we've made a terrible mistake with dad.",ans,ans,xxx
What?,q,q,xxx
Being dishonest with him. I mean that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,ans,ans,xxx
What do you mean dishonest?,q,q,xxx
You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,q,ans,fru
"What do you want to do, argue with him?",q,q,fru
"No I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore.",ans,ans,fru
"Why -- why shouldn't he dream of him? Walk around, waiting for him at night I mean do we contradict him, do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore that we haven't had hope for years now?",q,q,fru
You can't say that to him.,ans,ans,fru
We've got to say it to him.,c,dag,ang
"Can you prove it, how can you prove it?",q,q,fru
"For God sakes it's been three years, nobody comes back after three years, that's insane.",ans,ans,ang
To you it is and to me. You can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you?,q,q,fru
Sit down mom; I want to talk to you.,c,c,xxx
"The trouble is the god damned newspapers, every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere, so the next one is going to be Larry.",s,s,xxx
All right. All right. Listen to me.,c,c,fru
You know why I brought Annie here don't you?,q,q,neu
You know.,ans,ans,neu
I got an idea but what's the story?,q,q,neu
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,ans,ans,neu
"Well that's only your business, Chris.",o,o,xxx
No it's not only my business.,dag,dag,fru
What do you want me to do; you're old enough to know your own mind.,q,q,fru
So it's all right then I'll go ahead with it?,s,q,fru
"Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't-",s,s,neu
See it isn't just my business-,s,s,ang
I'm just saying,s,s,fru
Sometimes you infuriate me you know that. Isn't it your business to if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it? You have such a talent for ignoring things.,o,o,xxx
I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.,s,s,xxx
She's not Larry's girl.,dag,dag,fru
From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.,s,s,neu
"You can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go, see I don't know. So what can I do for you?",q,q,fru
"I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.",o,o,ang
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.,o,o,neu
To hell with that.,dag,dag,ang
Have you asked Annie yet?,q,q,fru
I wanted to get this settled first.,ans,ans,neu
How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.,q,q,neu
"Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.",ans,ans,neu
"I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.",ans,c,sad
"Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.",o,o,ang
So what I'm not fast with women.,s,s,fru
I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,s,q,ang
Because it is.,s,ans,fru
That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. I mean you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's five years.,s,s,fru
"I can't help it I know her best. I mean lived next door to her my whole life. These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.",o,o,fru
"What do you want, a diagram?",q,q,xxx
"I don't want a diagram. He thinks he's coming back. Chris, you marry this girl you're pronouncing him dead.",ans,ans,fru
"Do you know what's going to happen to your father because I don't, see?",q,q,fru
All right. All right. Mom.,a,a,xxx
Just give it some more thought.,c,c,xxx
"I've given it three years of thought. I thought that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.",o,o,xxx
"If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out.",s,o,sad
What the hell is this?,q,q,ang
"I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York.",ans,ans,sad
"What the hell is this, are you crazy?",q,q,ang
"I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.",ans,ans,ang
What about the business? What is this?,q,q,ang
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ans,ans,ang
Must you be inspired?,q,q,ang
"Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.",ans,ans,ang
"Tell me, you'd leave the business?",q,q,ang
"Yes, on this I would.",ans,ans,sad
"Well, you don't want to think like that.",c,o,ang
Then help me stay here.,c,c,fru
"All right. But you don't want to be thinking like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for, I mean the whole thing is for you, Chris, the whole shooting match is for you.",s,ag,xxx
I know I know mom. All right. Just help me stay here.,ag,ag,fru
Just don't go thinking that way.,c,c,fru
"Well, I am thinking that way.",ans,dag,fru
"I don't understand you, do I?",q,q,fru
"No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.",ans,ans,xxx
"Yea, I can see that.",ag,ag,sad
Why did he invite her here?,q,q,ang
Why does that bother you?,q,q,xxx
She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden-,ans,ans,ang
"Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.",ans,o,neu
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,o,o,ang
"What do you mean? He lived next door to the girl all his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?",q,q,fru
"Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.",c,s,fru
He's not going to marry her.,c,c,ang
How do you know he's even thinking of it?,q,q,neu
It's got that all about it.,ans,ans,xxx
"Well, so what?",q,q,neu
What's going on here Joe?,q,q,ang
"All right. Now, listen kid-",b,b,xxx
-She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not.,s,s,ang
You can't read her mind.,o,o,neu
"Then why is she still single, I mean New York is full of men, why isn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy but she's waited.",o,o,fru
How do you know why she has waited?,q,q,fru
"She knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",ans,ans,fru
"Look it's a nice day, what are we arguing for?",q,q,fru
"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away Joe. Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",o,ans,fru
What do you want me to do about it?,q,q,fru
"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense",ans,ans,ang
But Kate,b,b,fru
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. And laugh -- laugh at me but",s,s,fru
"why did that happen the very night she came back she sleeps in his room and suddenly his memorial breaks to pieces, just look at it, look.",s,s,xxx
Calm yourself.,c,c,fru
I need you to believe with me; I can't stand all alone.,o,o,sad
Calm yourself.,c,c,fru
"Even last week there was a man who showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.",s,s,fru
All right. All right. Calm yourself.,c,c,fru
Just you above all need to believe.,o,o,fru
"Wait, why my above all?",q,q,xxx
Don't stop believing.,ans,ans,fru
"What does that mean, me above all?",q,q,ang
Look at you -- look at you shaking.,s,s,ang
I can't help it.,o,s,fru
"What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",q,q,fru
You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,s,o,xxx
"I know, it went out of style, didn't it?",q,q,hap
It's all right.  It's a good thing.,ans,ans,hap
"You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.",o,o,hap
You're not sorry you came?,q,q,xxx
"No, not sorry.  But, um. But I'm not gonna stay.",ans,ans,hap
Why?,q,q,xxx
"For one thing, your mother as much as told me to go.",ans,ans,xxx
Oh.,b,dag,xxx
"You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um--",s,s,xxx
What?,q,q,sur
"Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.",ans,ans,xxx
"The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you on a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.",s,s,fru
"I knew they would, your mother anyway.",ag,ag,hap
How'd you know?,q,q,xxx
"Well, from her point of view, why else would I come?",ans,ans,neu
"Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know, this is why I asked you to come.",ans,o,xxx
I guess this is why I came.,o,o,hap
"Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",o,o,xxx
I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.,s,s,xxx
I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.,o,o,exc
"You feel wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.",o,o,xxx
"Oh, Chris, I've been ready for a long, long time.",s,o,xxx
And he's gone forever.  You're sure?,q,q,xxx
I almost got married two years ago.,ans,ans,xxx
Why didn't you?,q,q,sur
"Well, you started to write me",ans,ans,hap
You felt something that far back?,q,q,exc
Every day since.,ans,ans,hap
"Ann, why didn't you let me know?",q,q,exc
"Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you can sure be ambiguous sometimes, you know?",ans,ans,xxx
"Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a-",c,c,xxx
"God, I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",o,o,xxx
"I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  I mean, all I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.",o,o,xxx
"Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm gonna make you so happy.",o,o,xxx
Not like that you're not.,o,o,xxx
I kissed you.,s,s,xxx
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it?",q,q,xxx
Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.,s,s,sad
"No.  What is it, Chris. Your mother?",q,q,xxx
No.  Nothing like that.,ans,ans,sad
"Well, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",q,q,sad
"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",ans,ans,sad
You've gotta tell me.,c,c,xxx
I don't know how to start.,s,s,xxx
It wouldn't work this way.,s,s,sad
"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in charge of a company?",q,q,xxx
"Yeah, sure.",ans,ans,xxx
"Well, I lost them.",s,s,sad
How many?,q,q,xxx
Just about all.,ans,ans,sad
gee.,b,b,xxx
It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.,o,o,sad
"For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had.",s,s,sad
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",o,o,sad
"To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",o,o,sad
"Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.",s,s,sad
"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",s,s,sad
"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",o,o,sad
Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.,o,o,sad
Do you still feel that way?,q,q,sad
I want you now Annie.,ans,ans,neu
"Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris.  Everything, you understand that?  Me too.",o,o,sad
"I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.",o,o,sad
I know Annie.  I'm gonna make a fortune for you.,ag,ag,xxx
What'll I do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight.,q,q,exc
"God, this great, isn't it? Like look at the night we go here, it couldn't be better.",o,o,exc
"I would have wanted to go a little further up the coast, get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid we'd miss it.",o,o,xxx
How you doing?,q,q,exc
Fine.,ans,ans,neu
"Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell.",s,s,exc
"Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think?",q,q,exc
How you doing? You know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How - how could I forget to bring my flashlight? How could I be so stupid?,s,s,exc
What flashlight?,q,q,neu
"You know the flashlight, the silver one, there is only one, isn't there?",ans,ans,fru
That's not your flashlight.,s,s,fru
Who's is it?,q,q,fru
It's ours; it's mine too.,ans,ans,fru
"Oh well, sure, yes.",ag,ag,xxx
But you kept saying my flashlight as if somehow it's just yours. I mean how is it supposed to make me feel?,q,q,fru
"No. No. Of course our flashlight yours and mine. Mi flashlight, es su flashlight, naturally.",ag,ag,xxx
How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.,o,o,xxx
"I wonder do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year, do you remember?",q,q,xxx
Yea.,b,ans,neu
"You cold, you want my jacket? We should've - we should've brought our blanket, our blanket, how could we forget to bring the blanket?",s,s,exc
"Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget,",s,s,exc
"oh man. Like a kid, it's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.",o,o,exc
You think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,q,q,exc
I'm cold.,s,s,neu
What you want my jacket?,q,q,xxx
It's after eleven. Let's just go home.,s,s,fru
"Are you kidding, we'd miss it. We, we just got here. What's the point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home?",q,q,fru
There is no point in coming down here.,ans,ans,fru
Right.,ag,b,xxx
That's my point.,s,s,fru
That's my point too.,ag,ag,xxx
So let's go.,c,c,fru
No. No. That's not my point. The point is there is no point in coming down here if we just leave. Don't you want to see it?,dag,dag,xxx
Not particularly.,ans,ans,neu
Why not?,q,q,sur
"I don't, it's just stupid.",ans,ans,fru
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year.",s,s,exc
"Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up.",s,s,exc
"Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach flop around and swim away, and then they die.",s,s,fru
"Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that.",s,s,exc
"This is a big night for these guys, life's last orgy.",o,o,exc
What are you so excited about? I mean it's not a moon landing we're talking about here it's fish. It's a fish nobody even eats.,o,o,fru
Yes they do.,dag,dag,fru
Augie,b,b,fru
"Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs",s,s,exc
"you know there is like, there is a certain mystery here, a magic, a bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you cannot be interested.",o,o,exc
I'm just not.,s,s,sad
For real?,q,q,sur
Yes.,ans,ans,neu
I don't get it. The first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life.,s,s,xxx
"And then last year I remember specifically you were so excited that you stubbed your toe on the way pushing me out of the house, and you didn't even notice until we got in the car.",s,s,fru
"Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions.",s,s,ang
We weren't in a good spot.,o,o,xxx
We didn't see them the first time either.,s,s,fru
We just weren't in a good spot; this is a much better spot. I've got good instincts for these things.,o,o,fru
"There is that, oh no that's just seaweed, isn't it?",q,q,exc
"This is, this is great, isn't it? I wouldn't miss this for anything. Now listen to this, I know you're not interested but just listen.",c,c,exc
"Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way,",s,s,exc
"they don't why, we don't know why. They didn't take a vote or anything; they didn't get a map or an invitation.",s,s,exc
"Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker, instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the California coast and started swimming. They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.",s,s,exc
"It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question,",o,o,exc
"they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.",s,s,exc
Look at me; I'm giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up.,s,s,exc
That's the wind.,s,s,neu
"Well, so what do you think?",q,q,xxx
About what?,q,q,neu
What I was saying.,ans,ans,xxx
It's ridiculous.,o,o,fru
So what do you think?,q,q,neu
About what?,q,q,xxx
What I was saying.,ans,ans,neu
It's ridiculous.,o,o,fru
Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,dag,dag,neu
It's PR. Someone sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,o,o,xxx
"Well, I'm not the only one look at all these people.",dag,dag,xxx
"Yea, sure everyone was sold the same story. I mean it keeps us all excited, keeps us coming back for more, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any second now if we can just get in on the action and find the right spot.",o,o,xxx
Are we talking about the same thing?,q,q,xxx
I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.,ans,ans,xxx
"Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong but are you having your period?",q,q,fru
Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.,ans,ans,ang
"Well, what's bugging you?",q,q,fru
We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.,ans,ans,ang
"There is nothing to it, we come here, the Grunion arrive, then do their little fish business, we go oh ah look, they go home, we go home.",s,s,fru
For heavens sake we are not going to see the Grunions.,o,o,fru
Why not?,q,q,fru
"We never do, do we? I mean have we ever?",q,q,fru
We've missed them twice; that's not ever.,ans,ans,fru
"Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever.",s,s,fru
"Well, we'll see them this year.",o,o,neu
"No we won't; it's pointless. It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus,",dag,dag,fru
I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.,o,o,ang
I thought you wanted to see them.,o,o,fru
You don't understand anything I'm saying.,s,s,fru
No of course not.,dag,dag,fru
"I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is.",o,o,ang
"It's just fish, I mean nothing to get traumatized over.",o,o,xxx
For heavens sake this isn't about fish.,s,s,fru
All right. I've been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst.,s,s,fru
"You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said",s,s,neu
"the Grunion are running tonight, I said ""great, let's go, I feel lucky,""",s,s,neu
"okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-",s,s,neu
Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.,s,s,sad
"We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",s,s,sad
And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them,s,s,sad
"and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be",s,s,sad
Wait a minute I've got it,c,c,xxx
"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",s,s,sad
"It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?",q,q,exc
"Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?",q,q,exc
I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.,ans,ans,sad
"Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?",q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,sad
You want to go get some champagne?,q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,sad
Take off our shoes?,q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,xxx
"What, you want me to breathe in your ear?",q,q,xxx
No.,ans,ans,xxx
Get married again?,q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,fru
What? What? You want a divorce?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,fru
A vacation?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,fru
"A new carpet? A poodle, a ice cream, backrub, a suicide pact, what, what Carla, what the hell do you want?",q,q,fru
I want something to turn out the way that it supposed to.,ans,ans,fru
"Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?",q,q,ang
"You think I knew that there be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex, or that I'd look at you and think holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska?",s,s,xxx
"No, no, just like you I thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three, fat, rosy kids and ha-ha baby the joke is on us",o,o,fru
"cause you know what you get Carla, you know what you get? This.",s,s,fru
"This? What, what is this? This isn't even anything.",s,s,fru
"Yes, it is.",dag,dag,xxx
"I'm sure, this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, this is fighting.",o,o,fru
Right.,ag,ag,xxx
"Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.",o,o,sad
"No, I know. Me neither.",ag,ag,sad
I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?,q,q,fru
I'm doing the best I can.,ans,ans,xxx
I know that Augie. Really I do.,ag,ag,xxx
"I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",o,o,sad
Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,o,o,sad
I didn't say that.,dag,dag,xxx
"No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.",ag,ag,sad
"For heavens sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.",o,o,xxx
Yeah?,q,q,xxx
Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?,q,q,hap
"You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.",o,o,sad
"Now that you mention it. No, I don't.",dag,dag,hap
"Okay.  Fine, so we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.",o,o,xxx
I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.,o,o,hap
"Yes, I noticed that. It looks pretty on the water doesn't it? Big old white moon.",o,o,xxx
What have we got here?,s,s,hap
"Augie, you brought refreshments.",s,s,xxx
It's not champagne.,s,s,xxx
"Well, I guess we don't need glasses.",s,s,hap
You still cold? Do you want my jacket? Do you want to go home?,q,q,xxx
No. No. I think you might be right. I think this may be the spot after all.,ans,ans,xxx
"Augie, I'm sorry.",ap,ap,sad
"Shh, if we're very quiet the fish might come.",o,o,hap
Or not.,o,o,hap
Or not.,o,ag,hap
Hmm.,b,b,neu
Good God.,s,s,fea
Do you think it's them?,q,q,xxx
I wonder.,ans,ans,xxx
"Well, nobody knows we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",s,s,xxx
Must be them then.,o,o,fea
What are we going to do?,q,q,exc
"We're all right darling, aren't we whatever happens?",s,s,fea
Now and always sweet.,ag,ag,hap
I don't care then.,s,s,xxx
It's bound to come sooner or later.,s,s,xxx
Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number.,s,s,exc
Oh. It sends shivers down my spine.,s,s,exc
What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,q,q,fea
With the most perfect poise.,q,q,hap
"Yes, I should probably to a court curtsey.",ans,ans,hap
"Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy, do they?",q,q,hap
What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,ans,ans,xxx
Oh darling don't say that.,c,c,sad
It's true; the whole business is a very poor joke.,o,o,xxx
Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love?,q,q,hap
Yes. Meaning just that.,ans,ans,xxx
What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth?  Good God what does it all mean?,q,q,hap
Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.,c,c,xxx
"You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.",o,o,exc
Who's they?,q,q,exc
"All those futile moralists, who try to make life unbearable, laugh at them, be flippant. Laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths",ans,ans,xxx
flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light.,o,o,exc
"Well, if I laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too.",o,o,xxx
"Certainly you must, we figures of fun all right.",ag,ag,exc
"Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?",q,q,xxx
"No, that desire will fade along with our passion.",ans,ans,sad
"Oh dear, should we like that?",q,q,sad
Depends on how well we play it.,ans,ans,xxx
"Well, what happens if one of us dies, does the one that's left still laugh?",q,q,fea
"Yes, yes, with all his might.",ans,ans,exc
"Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",q,q,xxx
"No, no it isn't, death is very laughable, such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.",ans,ans,exc
"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",o,o,xxx
So is everyone else in the long run.,o,o,exc
"Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers, let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can. Like quite idiotic, very small, school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment.",o,o,exc
Come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,c,o,exc
"Elliot, worms don't pop.",s,s,xxx
"I don't care what you do see. You can paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome, and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word, as long as you love me best.",o,o,xxx
"Thank you dear, the same applies you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",o,o,xxx
You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,q,q,hap
Which particular one?,q,q,hap
"The one when you bought that little, painted, wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.",ans,ans,xxx
"Oh Charles, that was his name Charles. It did wiggle so beautifully.",s,s,hap
"Horrible thing, I hated it.",o,o,xxx
I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal; I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,ag,ag,hap
How long did that row last?,q,q,xxx
It went on intermittently for days.,ans,ans,hap
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burned a hole in my new dressing gown.,s,s,xxx
It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,s,s,hap
"That was a rouser, wasn't it?",q,q,hap
That was the first time you ever hit me.,ans,ans,xxx
I didn't hit you very hard.,o,o,xxx
The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,s,s,hap
I'll never forget his face.,s,s,hap
"Oh it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous.",o,o,hap
We were very much younger then.,s,s,xxx
And very much sillier.,o,o,hap
As a matter of fact the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,s,s,xxx
You knew there was nothing in that.,dag,dag,exc
I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,s,s,ang
"Presents, just a trivial little broach.",s,s,exc
"Yes, I remember it well, bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.",s,s,xxx
No it wasn't. It was very pretty I still have it and I wear it often.,dag,dag,neu
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,s,s,ang
"No I didn't, you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.",dag,dag,neu
"You must admit he was in love with you, wasn't he?",q,q,xxx
"Just a little perhaps, nothing serious.",ans,ans,xxx
You let him kiss you; you said you did.,s,s,ang
What of it?,b,q,neu
What of it?,b,b,xxx
"It gave him a lot of pleasure, it didn't hurt me any.",s,s,neu
What about me?,q,q,ang
"Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn't have known anything about it.",ans,ans,neu
That's a nice point of view I must say.,o,o,xxx
I'm bored of this conversation.,o,o,fru
"Yes, me too, bored stiff. You want some Brandy?",q,q,xxx
No thanks.,ans,ans,neu
I have a little I think.,s,s,neu
I don't see why you want any you've already had two glasses.,s,s,xxx
"No particular reason. Anyhow, they are very small ones.",s,s,neu
It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,o,o,neu
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.,o,o,neu
"Well, it's become a habit with you.",o,o,neu
You needn't be so grand just because don't happen want any yourself right now.,o,o,xxx
Don't be so stupid.,o,o,xxx
"Really, Amanda.",dag,dag,xxx
What?,q,q,ang
Nothing.,ans,ans,fru
No I'm just making myself fascinating for you.,ans,ans,neu
"Going out somewhere, dear?",q,q,neu
It's a woman's job to allure the man,o,o,xxx
That reply has broken my heart.,s,s,xxx
"watch me a minute, will you?",q,q,xxx
"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",ag,ag,neu
"Oh, no it isn't.",dag,dag,fru
Yes it is.,dag,dag,xxx
Be quiet.,c,c,ang
It's a pity you didn't have any more Brandy it might have made you a little less disagreeable.,o,o,xxx
It doesn't seem to work such wonders with you.,o,o,xxx
"Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",o,o,fru
Adders don't snap they sting.,dag,dag,xxx
Oh nonsense they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,dag,dag,fru
They sting.,dag,dag,xxx
They snap.,dag,dag,fru
I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.,o,o,ang
"Tell me, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?",q,q,neu
"Yes, I did quite a lot.",ans,ans,neu
I imagine you let him kiss you good deal more then.,o,o,xxx
Mind your own business.,c,c,xxx
What riotous time you must have had.,o,o,ang
"No restraint at all, very enjoyable, never had much anyhow.",o,o,ang
You're quite insufferable. I expect it's because you're drunk.,o,o,xxx
I am not in the least drunk.,dag,dag,xxx
"I imagine, as I may have already mentioned, I've had three minute liquor glasses of Brandy the whole evening long a child of two couldn't get drunk on that.",o,o,xxx
On the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of Brandy.,o,o,xxx
"Oh very interesting. How about a child of four, a child of six or a child of nine?",q,q,xxx
Oh be quiet.,c,c,ang
"We can get a good little debate going about that, don't you think? Intemperate tots.",o,o,ang
"Not very funny my dear, you better have some more Brandy.",o,o,xxx
All right. I will.,ag,ag,neu
Better turn that off I think.,o,o,neu
Why?,q,q,xxx
Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs.,ans,ans,xxx
There aren't any people upstairs it's a photographer's studio.,s,s,xxx
There are people downstairs I suppose?,q,q,xxx
They're away in Tunis.,ans,ans,xxx
This is no time of the year for Tunis.,o,o,xxx
"Turn it on again, please.",c,c,xxx
I'll do no such thing.,dag,dag,fru
"Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.",dag,dag,fru
Turn it off it's driving me mad.,c,c,xxx
You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.,o,o,ang
Turn it off.,c,c,ang
Stop it. Stop it. I hate you.,c,c,ang
"Amanda, listen. Listen.",c,c,ang
"Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.",o,o,ang
Very amusing indeed.,dag,dag,ang
"Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.",o,o,ang
"You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live.",o,o,ang
"This is the end, do you hear? The end finally and forever.",s,s,ang
You're not going like this.,c,c,ang
Oh yes I am.,dag,dag,ang
You're not.,dag,dag,ang
"Yes, I am. Let go of me you're cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you. Thank God I realized who you really are before I would ever, ever marry you again. I would never marry you again. I'd rather die in torment.",o,o,ang
Shut up.,c,c,ang
Shut up.,c,c,ang
I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.,o,o,ang
You're a beast. I hate you. Stop it. Stop it.,o,o,ang
"God, finally I got to the line, the front of the line. I've been waiting there for like half an hour.",s,s,xxx
[BREATHING] It's so hot in here. Hoo.,o,s,xxx
Yeah.,ag,ag,xxx
"Oh, um-",b,b,neu
What's wrong?,q,q,neu
"You didn't fill this out right. All right. It says that you have to fill out the back sheet of this, but you filled out the yellow sheet of it.",s,ans,neu
"No, no, no, no, no, no. The lady over there, she told me to fill out the front and she said to wait in this line.",dag,dag,fru
Who?,q,q,neu
I don't know. Some lady. Sonya or something.,ans,ans,fru
She- she probably doesn't even work here.,s,s,neu
"Excuse me? No, no. I waited in the line over there..",s,s,fru
All right  Uh-,b,b,neu
and she told me to come over here and she said to fill out everything on the application and I did that.,s,s,fru
It's not right.,s,s,fru
"Look, I-- No, no, no, I--you don't understand. I have to go back to work.",s,s,fru
You just take--all right.,b,b,fru
"Well, you didn't fill this paper at work out right and it's going to take another fifteen minutes to do it and look at how long the line we got here so just-",s,s,fru
I am not-,s,s,fru
"okay, just go back and fill it out real quick and I'm sorry, you have to get back in line and wait. I can't let you cut.",c,c,fru
But you don't understand. I cannot get back in line because I have to go back to work. I will get fired if I don't leave here.,dag,dag,fru
"Well, maybe you should have got here earlier than so you had a lot of time to do this.",o,o,xxx
But I was at work and the lady told me to come and work it and to stand in the line.,s,s,xxx
I don't know who this lady is.,s,s,xxx
[LAUGHTER],oth,oth,fru
"I really want to say that. Well I, so, you know, at the center department they called me in and I talked to-",s,s,xxx
"Oh, yeah? What did they say?",q,q,xxx
Well umm- actually they--I was promoted.,ans,ans,exc
"Oh, wow. That's great.",o,o,xxx
And Uh- Yeah. Uh- They're going to need um- more nurses on call for uh- to go overseas to help out with the war.,s,s,sad
"And uh - seeing as I was uh- promoted and head of the department now, and so- well, they asked me to go.",s,s,xxx
yeah.,ag,b,sad

and we will take care of it if anything happens.  But all we can do now is ask for your patience.,s,s,neu
Okay? Thank you for calling.  Goodbye.,g,g,neu
What's he going to say? Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.,o,o,xxx
He saw it.,s,s,neu
"What-how did he see it? I mean, I was the first one up. He was still in bed.",q,q,xxx
He was out there when it happened.,ans,ans,neu
When?,q,q,xxx
I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen.,ans,ans,neu
Did you talk to him?,q,q,neu
"No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone.",ans,ans,neu
"He cried hard, huh?",q,q,neu
I could hear it right through the floor.,s,ans,neu
What was he doing out there at that time? He was dreaming about him again. He's walking around at night again.,q,q,xxx
I guess he is.,ag,ans,neu
"Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died, you know?",q,o,neu
What's the meaning in that?,q,q,xxx
I don't know.,s,ans,neu
"But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad.",o,o,neu
"Well, what do you mean? What?",q,q,xxx
Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,ans,ans,neu
"What do you mean, dishonest?",q,q,neu
You know Larry's not coming back and I know that too. Why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?,ans,ans,xxx
"What, you're going to argue with him?",q,q,fru
"No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time that he realized that no one believes that Larry's coming back anymore.",ans,ans,fru
You can't tell him that.,c,c,fru
We got to tell him that.,c,dag,fru
We can't. It just won't work.,ans,o,fru
"You know, for God's sakes it's been three years. No one comes back after three years. It's insane.",o,o,fru
They do come back.,ans,dag,neu
"I know, but he doesn't know that.",ag,s,xxx
Three years has been a long time.,s,s,xxx
"All right. Just- Sit down, mom. I want to talk to you.",c,c,fru
"It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry.",s,s,ang
"All right. All right. Just come on, sit down.",c,c,fru
What?,q,q,fru
"You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?",q,q,neu
Why?,q,q,neu
You know.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, I have an idea, but go on, tell me, what's the story?",q,q,xxx
I want to ask her to marry me.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, that's only your business, Chris.",o,o,neu
"Come on, you know that's not only my business.",dag,dag,fru
"Well, it is. I mean, what do you want me to do? You're grown up; you know what's going on in your mind.",q,q,fru
So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, you better make sure your father's not- No- I'm just saying.",s,s,fru
"See, then it's not just my business. God, you have",s,s,ang
"-Oh, you infuriate me sometimes. You know, it's not just my business too if dad throws a fit.",o,o,ang
God. You have such a talent for ignoring things.,o,o,xxx
"Yeah, well I ignore what I got to ignore.",ag,ag,fru
And she-she's Larry's girl.,s,s,fru
"No, she is not Larry's girl.",dag,dag,xxx
"Well, from your father's point of view she is. I mean, he's still alive. You've got no right to take her.",dag,dag,fru
"If you go on from that point, I don't know where you go.",o,o,xxx
"Cause listen, I'm telling you, I don't know where to go from there. Do you?",q,q,fru
"Oh, I don't know.",ans,ans,xxx
What do you want from me?,q,q,fru
"Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.",o,o,sad
You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.,o,o,neu
To hell with that.,dag,dag,ang
There's nothing wrong with it.,o,o,neu
I didn't ask Annie yet.,ans,ans,neu
You didn't ask her yet?,q,q,fru
I wanted to get this settled first.,ans,s,neu
"Well, how do you know she's going to marry you? I mean, what if she feels the same way as your father?",q,q,xxx
Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.,ans,ans,neu
"I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right?",q,q,neu
"Mom, don't avoid me.",c,c,fru
"You know, the trouble is you've never had enough women. No, you never did.",o,o,fru
So what? I'm not fast with women.,ag,s,fru
I don't understand why it has to be her.,q,q,fru
Because it is.,s,ans,neu
"That's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.",o,o,fru
I just-,b,b,fru
"I mean, you haven't seen her since the war. I mean, it's been five years.",s,s,fru
It just is. I-,b,b,neu
"I grew up with her. Okay. All these years, when I think of someone I want to be my wife I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?",q,q,fru
"No, I don't want a diagram.",ans,ans,fru
"He thinks he's coming back. You go-go on and marry her, I mean, you're pronouncing her dead. And what's going to happen to your father, huh? I don't know. Do you?",s,s,fru
"Okay. All right, then.",a,a,fru
"Just, listen. Give it more thought, is all.",c,c,fru
"No, I've given it three years of thought.",s,s,fru
And I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,o,o,xxx
But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.,s,o,neu
What the hell is this?,q,q,xxx
I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.,ans,ans,neu
You're crazy.,o,o,xxx
I've been a sucker too long. I'm through with it.,o,o,xxx
You're what-you're going to leave the business? But you can't do that. What the hell is this?,q,q,fru
The business. The business doesn't inspire me.,ans,ans,fru
"Oh, you have to be inspired.",q,q,fru
Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.,ans,ans,ang
"Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.",s,s,ang
"Now, where do I find it?",s,q,neu
Tell me something.,c,c,neu
You'd leave that business.,q,q,neu
Yes. On this I would.,ans,ans,neu
You can't do that.,dag,dag,fru
Then help me stay here.,c,c,neu
"All right, but you can't do that. You can't talk like that.",ag,ag,fru
Okay. Just-,ag,ag,neu
"We've worked all our lives for you. Only for you, Chris. The whole shootin' match is for you.",o,o,fru
"Yeah, I know, I know, just help me stay here, all right?",ag,ag,fru
I'm going to.,ag,a,neu
You just can't talk like that.,c,c,xxx
I am thinking like that.,dag,dag,neu
"I don't know you, do I?",q,q,neu
"No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.",ans,ans,neu
Yeah. I can see that.,ag,ag,neu
Why did you invite her here?,q,q,ang
Why? Does that bother you?,q,q,xxx
She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and-,ans,ans,ang
"Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.",ans,o,neu
You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.,o,o,ang
"What do you mean? They lived next door to each other their entire lives. Why shouldn't he want to see her? Hey, don't look at me like that. I don't know anymore than you do.",q,q,xxx
He's not going to marry her.,c,c,xxx
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,q,q,neu
It's got that about it.,ans,ans,ang
"Well, so what?",q,q,neu
"What's going on here, Joe?",q,q,xxx
"Listen, kid-",b,b,fru
She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.,dag,s,ang
You can't read her mind.,o,o,neu
Then why is she married? Then why isn't she married? She's been in New York and there's hundreds of single men there.,o,o,xxx
"I'm sure hundreds of them asked her and told her that she's foolish, but no.",o,o,xxx
She's waited.,s,s,xxx
How do you know why she's waited?,q,q,neu
"Because she thinks like me, that's why.",ans,ans,xxx
"She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her-",o,o,sad
"I think again, that I'm-I'm right.",o,o,xxx
"Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?",q,q,neu
"Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother.",ans,ans,ang
Calm yourself.,c,c,neu
Because he's not coming back. Then what do I got to live for? I'll kill myself.,o,s,xxx
Calm yourself.,c,c,fru
"Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.",c,c,ang
"Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe.",s,s,ang
All right. All right. Calm yourself.,c,c,ang
"You got to believe, believe with me because I can't stand all alone.",o,o,xxx
Okay. Just calm yourself.,c,c,fru
"No, you've got to believe.",c,c,sad
"Believe, Joe. You above all people have got to believe.",o,o,xxx
"Why me, above all?",q,q,ang
Huh?,q,q,ang
Why me above all?,q,q,ang
You got to keep believing.,ans,ans,sad
"Look at you, you're shaking.",s,s,ang
I can't help it.,o,s,sad
What have I got to hide?,q,q,ang
"Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate?",q,q,ang
"No, it's all right. There's nothing wrong in that, you know.",ans,ans,hap
It's really lovely here. The air is sweet.,o,o,hap
You're not sorry you came?,q,q,neu
No. I'm not sorry. It's-,ans,ans,sad
I can't stay.,ans,s,xxx
Why not?,q,q,xxx
"Well, for one thing, your mother so much has told me to go. [LAUGHTER].",ans,ans,fru
Well-,b,b,neu
"Look,",c,c,xxx
"you've been acting kind of, well, you know.",s,s,xxx
What?,q,q,neu
"Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.",ans,ans,sad
"Yes, I guess I have been. But it's going from me now.",ans,ag,xxx
"Oh look, um, well, the thing is, I was planning on, planning on sort of sneaking up on you over a week or so, and they-they take it for granted we're all set.",s,s,hap
Yeah.,ag,ag,xxx
How did you know?,q,q,xxx
"Yeah, they would. Especially your mom.",ans,ans,xxx
"Well, uh- would you want to?",q,q,xxx
"I, I guess that's why I asked you to come.",o,o,hap
"Well, I mean,",ag,ag,hap
"Oh, Annie.",a,a,hap
"from her opinion, why else would I come here?",o,o,hap
"Annie, I love you.",o,o,hap
I love you a great deal.,o,o,hap
I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it.,s,s,hap
"Well, I guess that's why I came.",o,o,hap
"I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here, don't you? This yard and this chair.",s,o,hap
I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me.,o,o,hap
"I've been ready for a long, long time.",s,o,hap
Then he's gone forever. You're sure?,q,q,xxx
Look,c,c,xxx
I was almost married two years ago.,ans,ans,xxx
Why didn't you?,q,q,sur
Cause you started to write me.,ans,ans,xxx
You felt something that far back?,q,q,hap
Every day since.,ans,ans,hap
Why didn't you let me know?,q,q,hap
"Well, I don't know, you didn't write until then and then when you did, what'd you say?",ans,ans,xxx
You always can be so ambiguous.,o,o,xxx
"Give me a kiss, Annie.",c,c,hap
Give me-,c,c,hap
"[LAUGHTER]. God, I kissed Annie. I kissed Annie. How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",o,o,xxx
I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.,o,o,hap
We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.,o,o,hap
"Not like that, you're not.",o,o,xxx
I kissed you.,s,s,hap
"Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris.",o,o,hap
What is it?,q,q,xxx
Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.,ans,ans,sad
No. What is it? Is it your mother?,q,q,sad
"No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.",ans,ans,neu
"Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.",q,q,sad
"Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now.",ans,ans,sad
You should tell me.,o,o,sad
I don't know where to start.,s,s,sad
"But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.",s,s,sad
You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.,s,s,sad
"Yeah, sure.",ans,ag,sad
"Well, I lost them.",s,s,sad
How many?,q,q,sad
Just about all.,ans,ans,sad
Geez.,b,b,sad
It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.,o,o,sad
"For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket.",s,s,sad
"I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.",o,o,sad
"And I, and I thought something watching them go down.",o,o,sad
"Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?",o,o,sad
And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.,o,o,sad
And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.,s,s,sad
And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.,s,s,sad
"And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.",s,s,sad
"Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.",o,o,sad
And I didn't want to take any of it.,o,o,sad
And I guess that included you.,o,o,sad
And you still feel that way?,q,q,sad
"I want you now, Annie.",ans,ans,xxx
"Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.",o,o,sad
"I mean, there's nothing wrong in that money, and your father put good planes up in the air and you should be proud of that. A man should be paid for that.",o,o,xxx
"Annie,",b,b,hap
"Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you.",o,o,hap
What am I going to do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
"Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it?",q,q,exc
Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.,o,o,exc
"You know actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the, the people and the lights, and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey, how you doing?",q,q,exc
Fine.,ans,ans,sad
"Oh, is that-is that-now, is that just foam, uhh, I can't even tell.",s,s,exc
"Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing?",q,q,exc
"Oh, do you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid. Oh, I-I should have brought my flashlight.",s,s,exc
What flashlight?,q,q,xxx
"Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?",ans,ans,exc
That's not your flashlight; it's ours. It's mine too.,ans,s,xxx
"Oh, well, sure.",ag,ag,xxx
"I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?",q,q,ang
"No, of course. Yours and mine. Our flashlight. Yours and mine. Mi flashlight is su flashlight. Naturally.",ag,ag,xxx
We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.,s,q,exc
I hope the moon stays out.,o,o,exc
"Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?",q,q,exc
Yes.,ans,ans,xxx
Are you cold? Do you want my jacket?,q,q,xxx
"We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket.",s,s,exc
"You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.",s,s,exc
I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].,o,o,exc
I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move.,q,q,exc
I'm cold.,s,s,xxx
Do you want my jacket?,q,q,neu
"It's past eleven, let's go home.",s,s,xxx
What? Are you kidding me? We just got here. We'd miss it. What's the point of coming down there if we just turn around and go home?,q,q,sur
There is no point in coming down here.,ans,ans,xxx
Right.,ag,b,neu
That's my point.,s,s,xxx
"Yeah, that's my point too.",ag,ag,neu
"Well, so let's go.",c,c,xxx
"No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave.",dag,dag,exc
"I mean, don't you want to see it?",q,q,neu
Not particularly.,ans,ans,sad
Why not?,q,q,neu
I don't know. I just don't.,ans,ans,sad
"Honey, this is a natural-this is a natural phenomenon. I mean, it only happens once a year. This is, this is a great opportunity. Think about the people in Kansas. They would have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservation to come and see this. We're only forty minutes away. This is too good to pass up.",s,s,xxx
Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.,s,s,ang
Yeah. But that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. And all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you-spawning or mating or something like that.,s,s,xxx
"I mean, this is the big night for these guys. Life's last orgy.",o,o,xxx
"I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean, it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats.",o,o,fru
"Yeah, they do.",dag,dag,xxx
"Oh, God, Augie.",b,b,fru
"What, okay, then it's fish that do something no other fish do. Like the swallows in Capistrano or the lemmings who throw themselves off the cliffs.",s,s,xxx
"There's magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable. I mean, I don't see how you cannot be interested.",o,o,xxx
"I'm just not. I mean, I'm sorry, it just-they're still fish to me.",s,s,xxx
For real?,q,q,sur
Yes.,ans,ans,xxx
I don't get it. The last time-the first time that we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life.,s,s,xxx
And then last year when we came to see it you ran out of the house so fast that you stubbed your toe. And you didn't even notice until you got in the car.,s,s,xxx
"Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions.",s,s,fru
We weren't in a good spot.,o,o,xxx
"No, for God's sakes, we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them.",s,s,fru
"We just weren't in a good spot, all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look, is that-",o,o,fru
"no, that's just seaweed, isn't it? This is great, isn't it?",q,q,xxx
"I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.",c,c,exc
Somewhere out there there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way. They don't know why. And we don't know why. Just some little instinctual time-release firecracker went off-went off in their bodies.,s,s,xxx
"And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.",s,s,exc
"You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one.",s,s,exc
"its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name.",o,o,exc
"They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here",s,s,exc
"where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, God, I'm giving myself goosebumps. Look, I'm all-all my hairs on my arms is sticking up.",s,s,exc
"Yeah, that's the wind.",s,s,xxx
So what do you think?,q,q,xxx
About what?,q,q,xxx
About what I just said.,ans,ans,neu
It's ridiculous.,o,o,xxx
And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words.,s,s,hap
"Oh, that moment-that was it.",s,s,hap
"I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.",s,s,sad
Wait a minute. I got it.,c,c,neu
Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.,s,s,hap
"It was driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, right? You said let's get some champagne, and I said time's-a-wasting or something like that.",s,s,xxx
"You want this to be like the other time, right? That's it. Right?",q,q,xxx
I don't want to remember something.,ans,ans,sad
Hope for some things.,o,s,sad
"Right. I got it. Of course. Listen, do you want to dance?",q,q,xxx
No.,ans,ans,sad
Do you want me to get some champagne?,q,q,xxx
No.,ans,ans,sad
Take off our shoes?,q,q,xxx
"No, no.",ans,ans,sad
What? What? Do you want me to breathe in your ear?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,fru
Do you want to get married again? What? What? Do you want to get a divorce?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,fru
No.,ans,ans,ang
A vacation?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,fru
A new carpet? A poodle?,q,q,fru
"A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?",q,q,ang
I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.,ans,ans,fru
"Jesus, welcome to the human race.",o,o,fru
Did you think this is how I thought it was going to turn out? Do you think I had some great fantasy down the line? That four years down the line that we'd come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?,q,q,xxx
"No, I was just like you. I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great. And the wind in our hair and the sand in our toes, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves, and we'll have three big fat rosy kids. And oh God.",o,s,fru
"You know what you get? The jokes on us, baby. Because do you know what you get? Huh? Carla? Do you know what you get? You get this.",s,s,fru
This what? What is this? This is nothing.,s,s,fru
"Yes, it is.",dag,dag,fru
"No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting.",dag,dag,ang
Right.,ag,ag,fru
Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.,o,o,sad
"No, I know. Me neither.",ag,ag,fru
"I mean, this is, this is everything, and it's a lot, but",o,o,xxx

"This has been going on for the past two weeks.  I called every single day.  Nobody is helping me.  You guys tell me the same thing over and over, call again, call again, call again--",ans,ans,fru
Um- I think part of it has to do with the network being down.  It's been having some trouble the last few weeks--,o,o,neu
"Okay.  Well that is, that is fine and all.  I don't care.  I really don't care because I want my phone to work that's all.",o,o,fru
"That is I am paying you guys for service and I'm not getting any service.  I get, I get just dropped calls all the time and now it's completely not working at all.  I can't even call out, nine one one probably wouldn't even work.",s,s,fru
Well you better.  You better give me a whole freaking new phone that's what you better do.,o,s,fru
"You sign the contract and then down the line the phone doesn't work and you're stuck, you can't go to a new...no.  No contracts for me.  You give me a new phone.",s,s,ang
"Besides, it's sort of out of hands at the moment----The whole electrical power outage.",s,s,fru
I want to talk to a supervisor,s,s,ang
I would like to talk to your supervisor.  Obviously you're incompetent and don't understand what I'm asking.,s,s,ang
"Um- Let me connect you to my supervisor.  Actually, he's out right now so I'm supervisor until he comes back. Um-",s,s,neu
What?,q,q,fru
"So you could----speak with me some more, you could call back later on maybe.",s,s,neu
That's ridiculous.  You know?,o,o,fru
"No I don't want to call back, you put me on hold for like hours and hours----and it's money, money, money, money and out of my pocket, out of my pocket--",ans,s,fru
I didn't put you on hold.,dag,dag,fru
There are a lot of people calling us having problems.  Every phone company is having the same problems ma'am,s,s,fru
Every phone...every single phone company?,q,q,fru
"I am a realtor and this is my business.  People are calling me all the time but you know, and I don't have a land line.  I can't afford to have a land line",s,s,ang
don't you-,b,b,neu
I'm really sorry ma'am.  There's not----a lot we can do for it.,ap,ap,neu
"What I can do for you, if you want to make a call right now I could contact you through our computer.  I can call through my phone and you can speak through me.",s,s,neu
What?  No.  That's way too complicated.  Look--,o,o,fru
you need to fix my phone.  I don't care what you have to do--,c,c,fru
"Well, okay I'm going to give you a free phone card that you can use at any payphone and that's on us. Okay?",s,s,neu
"Yeah yeah, woman going out in South Central on the payphone at night.  Oh that's real safe.",ans,dag,fru

A law firm.  Thank you very much.,g,g,fru
All right um--,ag,ag,neu
"I work out of my home as a realtor and because I don't have a land line, I need a phone and because of now I don't have one I don't know what to do.  And you're not helping me at all.",s,s,fru
"In fact, give me your name sir, what's your name again?",q,q,fru
My name is Sara.,ans,ans,neu

Okay.,b,b,-

Hello?,s,g,neu

Oh.  I'm sorry. Um- Did you drop it in water?,q,q,neu
"Yeah, yeah, yeah you better be sorry.",ag,o,ang
No I did not drop my phone in water.  I'm not five years old and just dropped my phone anywhere I see it.  Okay this is my business.,ans,ans,ang
Okay?  And it [GARBAGE]. My business is failing because my phone isn't working and I don't have a land line and I really can't handle this right now.,s,s,fru
Okay.,b,ag,-
"Um- well it's probably easy.  Can you any more symptoms either you're not receiving calls----ok, you're not receiving calls, not getting calls.",q,q,neu
"the symptoms- This [GARBAGE] a doctor's office. I'm not receiving calls...I can't receive- no, it's, it cuts me off--",ans,ans,fru
Is the phone turned on?,q,q,neu
Yes the phone turns on.  No I mean I'm using it not turning on the phone.  Of course it turns on.,ans,ans,fru
Alright.  Um- Well that could be the problem. cause--,o,o,neu
you might have an older phone where we would use sim cards but probably not.,s,s,neu
"Okay no.  Sir, this is the deal.  My phone isn't working and I don't care what the problem is but it needs to work.  That's why I'm paying you guys to fix it.",s,s,fru
Tell them my name.  My name is Brent Backersen.,s,s,neu

"Okay.  They can figure out pink for you.  So go in there and just tell them that and they'll hook you up with other goodies, stuff like that free service, no contract, no nothing.  Just for being a good customer",o,ag,neu
and battling through with us.,s,s,neu
"Alright. Well-  I guess - I guess that's okay but,",o,o,neu
Okay.,b,ag,neu
Alright?  Great.  Have a nice evening.,o,o,neu
Alright Thanks.,g,g,neu
What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.,o,o,neu
He was out there when it happened.,ans,ans,sad
When?,q,q,sur
About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.,ans,ans,sad
Well what was he doing out at four in the morning?,q,q,xxx
No.  I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.,ans,ans,sad
He cried hard?,q,q,sad
I could hear it right through the floor.,s,ans,sad
"God, what was he doing out there anyway?",q,q,xxx
Starting to dream about him again.  He's walking around at night again.,ans,ans,fru
I guess he is.,ag,ag,sad
"He's getting just like he did after he died, you know?  What, what, what's the meaning of this?",q,q,sad
"I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.",ans,ans,sad
What?,q,q,xxx
Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,ans,ans,fru
What do you mean dishonest?,q,q,xxx
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.,q,q,ang
"Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?",q,q,ang
That we haven't had any hope for years now?,q,q,ang
You can't say that to him.,ans,ans,xxx
Larry's been gone for three years.  For god sakes no one comes back after three years.  It's insane.,ans,ans,fru
"Listen mom, just, sit down.  I want to talk to you.",c,c,fru
No.  It's his god damned newspapers is what it is.  Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one.,s,s,ang
Alright. Alright. Alright just listen.,c,c,fru
"You know why I asked Annie here, right?",q,q,neu
Well I have an idea but I don't know.  What's the story?,q,q,xxx
I want to ask her to marry me.,ans,ans,neu
Well that's your business Chris.,o,o,xxx
You know it's not just my business.,dag,dag,fru
"Well what do you want me to do?  I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind.",o,o,ang
Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.,s,s,neu
"Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--",c,s,neu
Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things.,o,o,ang
Well I'm just saying--,s,s,fru
You know I ignore what I got to ignore.,s,s,xxx
She's not...she's Larry's girl.,s,s,xxx
She's not Larry's girl.,dag,dag,fru
From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair.  You can't do that.,s,s,fru
I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull back,o,o,fru
"And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there, then you can.  But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go.  You got it?  I mean, do you?",q,q,fru
Because other people will suffer.,o,o,xxx
"My whole entire, bloody life time and time again.",o,o,fru
Did you ask Annie yet?,q,q,neu
Then I guess that's the end of it.,ans,ans,neu
But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.,o,o,sad
"And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",c,c,neu
"Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean...",o,o,neu
Because it is.,s,s,fru
"Well that's a good answer but, it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you left to go to the war and it's been five years.",s,s,xxx
It's just...that's just the way it is.  That's how I feel.  You know these years when I think of someone I want to marry I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram?,q,q,fru
No I don't want a diagram.,ans,ans,fru
"He thinks he's coming back. And you go off and marry that girl and you're just pronouncing him dead and what's going to happen to him?  I don't know.  Do you?  I mean, I don't know.",s,s,fru
Alright then.,a,a,fru
"Look, just give it some thought okay?",q,q,xxx
I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,ans,ans,sad
But if I can't have that here I'll get out.,s,s,neu
What the hell is this?,q,q,xxx
I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.,ans,ans,neu
Are you crazy?,q,q,xxx
I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.,ans,ans,ang
You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.,q,q,ang
The business doesn't inspire me.,ans,ans,ang
"Oh, you have to be inspired.",q,q,xxx
Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.,ans,ans,ang
Yes.  On this I would.,ans,ans,neu
Alright but you can't talk like that you hear?,s,s,fru
"I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you.",s,s,ang
I know.  Just you help me stay here.,ag,ag,sad
Alright but you don't talk like that you hear?  You don't.,c,c,fru
I am thinking like that.,dag,dag,sad
I don't understand you do I?,q,q,sad
No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,ans,ans,sad
Yeah.  I can see that.,ag,ag,sad
Why did he invite her here?,q,q,ang
Why does that bother you?,q,q,fru
Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.,ans,q,ang
"Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.",ans,ans,neu
Nobody travels seven hundred miles just see.,s,s,xxx
uh-uh What do you mean?  They grew up next to each other their entire lives.  Why shouldn't he want to see her?,q,q,fru
Hey don't look at me like that.  I don't know anymore than you.,c,c,fru
He's not going to marry her.,c,c,xxx
Who said he even thought about that?,q,q,neu
I see it.  It has the appearance of it.,ans,ans,xxx
"Well, so what?",q,q,neu
What's going on here Joe?,q,q,xxx
Now listen kid...,c,c,fru
No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.,o,o,ang
You can't read her mind.,o,o,xxx
"Because she knows what I know, that's why.",ans,ans,xxx
it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.,o,o,sad
Look at how nice the day is.  What are we arguing for?,q,q,fru
"No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.",ans,ans,ang
What do you want me to do?  What do you want?,q,q,fru
I want-I want you to act like he's still alive.  I mean don't think I haven't seen the way that you've been since he invited her here.,ans,ans,xxx
But Kate...,b,b,fru
But I won't have any of this nonsense because you know what happens?  If he doesn't come back I'll kill myself.,o,o,xxx
"Laugh, laugh at me but I will.  Because you know what happened when she came here?  When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me.",s,s,ang
"Calm yourself, alright?",c,c,xxx
"Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe.",s,s,sad
"Alright, alright, calm yourself okay?  Calm yourself. Wait, wait.  What do you mean, me above all?",c,c,ang
"Look, just keep believing okay?",q,c,xxx
"Wait, what does that mean?  Me above all?",q,q,ang
"Look at you, you're shaking.",s,s,ang
I can't help it.,o,o,sad
What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate?,q,q,ang
You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.,s,s,xxx
I know.  It sort of went out of style didn't it?,q,q,xxx
"No.  It's alright.  It's a good thing, you know?",ans,ans,xxx
It's lovely here.,o,o,xxx
The air is so sweet.,o,o,xxx
You're not sorry you came?,q,q,neu
No.  I'm not sorry.  But I'm not going to stay.,ans,ans,sad
Well...,b,b,xxx
"Look,",c,c,sad
"you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of...",s,s,sad
What?,q,q,neu
"Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came.",ans,ans,sad
Well the trouble is I was planning on sneaking up on you over a week or so and they take it for granted that we're all set.,s,s,xxx
"Yeah.  I know they would, especially your mother.",ag,ag,xxx
How did you know?,q,q,xxx
"Well what other reason, from her point of view, would I be coming here?",ans,ans,xxx
"So, would you want to?",q,q,xxx
"I mean, that's the reason why I asked you here.",o,o,hap
I love you.,o,o,hap
I guess that's why I came.,o,o,hap
I don't...I have no imagination that's the only way I know how to tell it.,s,s,xxx
I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell you this here.  I wanted to drive someplace brand new where we'd be brand new to each other.  It feels wrong here don't you?,s,s,xxx
"This yard and this chair.  I don't want to win you from anything, I want you to be ready for me.",o,o,xxx
"Look, I've been ready for a long, long time now.",s,s,hap
"Then he's gone forever, you sure?",q,q,xxx
"Look, I almost got married two years ago.",ans,ans,hap
You felt something that far back.,s,q,hap
Every day since.,ans,ans,hap
Why didn't you let me know?,q,q,xxx
"I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say?",ans,ans,hap
You'd always be so ambiguous.,o,o,hap
"Give me a kiss Ann, just give me...",c,c,hap
"Oh God.  Annie, I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie.",s,s,exc
I'll never forgive you for that.,o,o,hap
"How long, how long I've been waiting to do that.",o,o,xxx
"I mean,  Why did you wait all these years?  There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.",o,o,hap
We're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.,o,o,hap
Not like that you're not.,o,o,hap
I kissed you.,s,s,xxx
Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you Chris.,o,o,xxx
"Nothing.  Hey, let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.",ans,ans,sad
What is it?,q,q,xxx
"No, what is it?  Your mother?",q,q,xxx
"No, nothing, nothing like that.",ans,ans,xxx
"Tell me what's wrong.  I mean, even in your letters you seemed ashamed.",q,q,xxx
"Well, yes I guess I've been ashamed but, it's going from me.",ans,ans,xxx
Okay.  It wouldn't work like this?,q,s,xxx
You remember overseas I was in command of a company?,q,q,sad
"Yeah, sure.",ans,ans,xxx
Well I lost them.,s,s,sad
How many?,q,q,sad
Just about all.,ans,ans,sad
Geez.,b,b,sad
Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.,o,o,sad
A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.,o,o,sad
"It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me?",o,o,sad
And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.,o,o,sad
And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.,s,s,sad
"And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all.",s,s,sad
"It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook,",s,s,sad
"open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator",s,s,sad
"cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that.",o,o,sad
Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.,o,o,sad
And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.,o,o,sad
And you still feel that way?,q,q,sad
I want you now Annie.,ans,ans,xxx
Cause you must not feel that way again.  You hear me?  You can't.  You deserve everything you have Chris.,o,o,xxx
"that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.",o,o,sad
[GARBAGE] Annie,ag,ag,xxx
Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.,o,o,hap
What am I going to do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
Buy some hats?,q,q,hap
"Hey, what time is it?  This pokes around midnight right?  God this is great isn't it?",q,q,exc
Look at the night we got.  I wouldn't trade this for anything.,o,o,exc
"Is that, is that, nah, is that just Paul?  I can't even tell.",s,s,exc
"But if I can't tell, it probably isn't them isn't it?  Probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think?  How are you doing?",q,q,exc
"Oh, you know what I forgot?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.",s,s,exc
What flashlight?,q,q,xxx
"You know, the flashlight, the silver one?  There's only one isn't there?",ans,ans,xxx
It's not your flashlight.,s,s,xxx
"Well, whose is it?",q,q,xxx
It's ours.  Mine too.,ans,ans,xxx
"No.  Of course, our flashlight.  Yours and mine.  Me flashlight is su flashlight, naturally.",ag,ag,xxx
How could we have not thought to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.,o,o,xxx
Was it a full moon last year when they were running?  I can't remember.  Do you remember?,q,q,xxx
Yes.,ans,ans,neu
Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?,q,q,xxx
"We should've brought the blanket, our blanket.",s,s,xxx
"God.  Oh, you know what would be good right about now?  A six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket.",s,s,exc
"I'm so stupid, I should've brought a six-pack.  God, I'm like a little kid.  It's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped up. Oh- [LAUGHTER]",o,o,exc
I wonder if they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,q,q,exc
"Look, I'm cold.",s,s,xxx
Do you want my jacket?,q,q,neu
"It's past eleven, let's go.",ans,ans,fru
What?  Are you kidding me?  We just got here.  We miss it.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?,q,q,xxx
There is no point in coming down here.,ans,ans,fru
Right.,ag,b,xxx
That's my point.,s,s,fru
That's my point too...No.  No.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point if we come down here if we just turn around and leave?,ag,ag,fru
So let's go.,c,c,xxx
Why not?,q,q,xxx
I don't know.  I just don't.,ans,ans,xxx
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  It only happens once a year.  I mean think about the people in Kansas, they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this.  We're only forty minutes away.  This is too good to pass up.",s,s,exc
"Pass up what?  These fish swim up to shore, on the beach and then they flop around a little, they swim away and then they die.",s,s,fru
"Well this is like the highlight, the one night of their lives and that flopping around, that's laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it.",s,s,exc
"But this is the big night for these guys.  Their last, life's last orgy.",o,o,exc
"What are you getting so excited about?  I mean, it's not like it's like the landing on the moon or something.  I mean, it's just fish, fish that nobody eats.",o,o,xxx
Yeah they do.,dag,dag,exc
Augie.,b,b,fru
"Okay.  But it's fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows in Capistrano or the Lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs, there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable.",s,s,exc
"I mean, I can't see how you can not be interested.",o,o,xxx
I'm just not.,s,s,neu
For real?,q,q,xxx
Yes.,ans,ans,xxx
"I don't get it.  I mean the first time we came to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.",s,s,xxx
And last year when we came you ran out of the house so fast you stubbed your toe and you didn't even notice it until we got in the car.,s,s,xxx
"You also could remember that I got sand in my panties, we got in an argument over nothing, you got a sore throat and we didn't even get to see the Grunions.",s,s,fru
Okay.  We're in a good spot.,o,o,xxx
You didn't see them the first time either.,s,s,fru
"We just weren't in the good spot.  This is a much better spot.  You know, I have a good instincts for these things.",o,o,fru
"Look, is that...no is that just seaweed?",q,q,exc
"You know, this is great isn't it?  You know, I wouldn't trade this for anything.",o,o,exc
"I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.",c,c,exc
"Somewhere out there, there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way, they don't why, we don't know why, they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies...",s,s,exc
"...like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming this way.  They didn't, you know, they didn't make a decision, they didn't, you know, have boats or anything.  No one sent them an invitation or a map, they just started swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.",s,s,exc
"It's single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't, they don't ask it a question, they don't give it a name, they just swim.",o,o,exc
They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.,s,s,exc
"Oh, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are standing up.",s,s,exc
That's the wind.,s,s,xxx
[BREATHING] So what do you think?,q,q,exc
About what?,q,q,xxx
About what I just said?,ans,ans,exc
So what do you think?,q,q,exc
About what?,q,q,ang
About what I just said?,ans,ans,fru
It's ridiculous.,o,o,ang
It certainly is not.  It's a slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,dag,dag,fru
"It's PR.  I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach.",o,o,ang
I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.,dag,dag,fru
"Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.",o,o,ang
Are we talking about the same thing?,q,q,fru
"Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.",ans,ans,ang
I thought you wanted to see it.,o,o,fru
It's just...,b,b,xxx
"Look, we just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to be like.",ans,o,xxx
"There's nothing to it.  The Grunions arrive, they do their little fish business, you know?  We go oh, ahh, look at the fish and they go home and we go home.",s,s,fru
"For heavens sake, grow up.  We're not going to see the Grunions.",o,o,fru
Why not?,q,q,fru
"We never do, do we?  Have we ever?",q,q,fru
"Oh my gosh.  We missed them twice, that's hardly ever.",ans,ans,fru
Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever.,s,s,ang
"Carla, can I ask you something?",q,q,fru
What?,q,q,xxx
"Don't take this wrong but, are you having your period?",q,q,fru
"Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.",ans,ans,ang
What's bugging you then?,q,q,fru
"Look, it's pointless.  It's...we're not going to see the Grunions I mean, it's like waiting around to see Santa Claus, you know, it's...",ans,ans,fru
"Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up.",s,s,ang
I thought you wanted to see it.,o,o,fru
"God, you don't understand anything.",s,s,fru
"No, of course not.",dag,dag,fru
"I do.  I always do.  I keep thinking, this time will be the time and it never is.",o,o,fru
"Well, we're going to see it.",o,o,neu
"No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie.",dag,dag,ang
"What...I've been trying to, I've been trying to figure out the point where we went wrong and I can't seem to pinpoint that moment.",s,s,fru
"You were fine during the phone call with Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem.",s,s,xxx
"Look, do you remember the first time we came here?",q,q,fru
We thought I was pregnant.,s,s,sad
We brought a bottle of champagne and we took off our shoes and danced barefoot in the sand...,s,s,xxx
Under the moon and you whispered so softly into my ear so I could feel your words.,s,s,xxx
"And I thought, this is it.  This is how happy I'm supposed to be.",s,s,xxx
Wait a minute.  I've got it.,c,c,neu
What?  Dancing barefoot in the sand?  Drinking out of a bottle of champagne?,q,q,xxx
It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker...,q,q,neu
And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that.,s,s,neu
You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right?,q,q,neu
I'd rather not remember something...,ans,ans,sad
Rather not hope for something.,ans,s,sad
"Okay, right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen, do you want to dance?",q,q,xxx
No.,ans,ans,sad
Do you want me to get some champagne?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,fru
Take off our shoes?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,fru
What?  Do you want me to breathe in your ear?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,fru
Do you want to get married again? What? What?  Do you want a divorce? A vacation? What?  A carpet?  A poodle?  A basket of fruit?  What?  A suicide pact?  What the hell do you want Carla?,q,q,xxx
No...No...No...,dag,ans,fru
No...,ans,s,fru
I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.,ans,o,ang
Welcome to the human race.,s,s,ang
Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No.,q,q,ang
I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...,o,o,ang
...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.,s,s,ang
"This what...what's this?  This isn't anything. Alright.  Sure.  Standing on the beach, fighting and waiting.",o,o,fru
Yes it is.,dag,ag,ang
Right.,ag,ag,ang
Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.,o,o,ang
No.  I know.  Me neither.,ag,ag,xxx
This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?,q,q,sad
I'm trying to do the best I can.,ans,ans,fru
I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice.,ag,ag,sad
I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.,o,o,sad
Maybe if you were with someone else too.,o,o,sad
I didn't say that.,dag,dag,sad
I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.,ag,ag,sad
"Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you.",o,o,sad
Yeah?,q,q,xxx
Yeah.  Don't you know that?,q,ans,xxx
If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard.,o,o,sad
"Actually, now that you mention it, no I don't.",dag,dag,xxx
"Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people.",o,o,sad
It seemed like a good spot to me.,o,o,xxx
I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here.,s,s,hap
Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water.,o,o,hap
Big old white moon.,o,o,xxx
"Hey, look what we got here.",s,s,hap
Oh you brought refreshments.,s,s,hap
It's not champagne.,s,s,xxx
Well at least we won't need glasses.,s,s,xxx
Are you still cold?  Do you want to go home?,q,q,xxx
No I'm beginning to think you might be right.,ans,ans,hap
I think this may be the place for us after all.,o,o,hap
I am sorry Augie.,ap,ap,hap
Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.,o,o,hap
Or not.,o,o,hap
Or not.,o,ag,hap
Good God.,s,s,xxx
Do you think it's them?,q,q,xxx
I wonder.,ans,ans,xxx
And nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up.,s,s,xxx
Well it must be them then.,s,s,xxx
What are you going to do?,q,q,xxx
We're fine right?  Aren't we?  Whatever happens darling.,s,s,xxx
Now and always sweet.,ag,ag,exc
I don't care then.,s,s,exc
"I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later.",s,s,exc
Hello?  Hello?  What?,s,s,xxx
That sent shivers up my spine.,s,s,exc
"No, wrong number.",s,s,exc
What are we to do if they suddenly walk in on us?,q,q,xxx
Behave exquisitely.,ans,ans,exc
With the most perfect poise?,q,q,xxx
Certainly.  And I shall probably do a court courtesy.,ans,ans,xxx
um- Things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy do they?,q,q,xxx
What is so horrible is that one cannot stay happy.,ans,ans,xxx
"Oh, darling.  Don't say that.",c,c,xxx
"It's true.  I mean, the whole business it's a very poor joke.",o,o,xxx
"You mean that, that sacred and beautiful thing love?",q,q,xxx
Yes.  I mean just that.,ans,ans,xxx
What does that all mean?  That's what I asked myself on my quest for ultimate truth.  What does it all mean?,q,q,xxx
Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,c,c,xxx
"[LAUGHTER] Oh, darling.  You mustn't be serious, that's just what they want.",o,o,xxx
Who's they?,q,q,xxx
All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.,ans,ans,xxx
Laugh at all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,o,o,xxx
So if I'm to laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too.,o,o,xxx
"Oh, certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun alright.",ag,ag,xxx
How long will it last?  This ludicrous overbearing love of ours?,q,q,xxx
Who knows?,ans,ans,xxx
Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,q,q,xxx
No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,ans,ans,xxx
"Well, dear, shall we want that?",q,q,xxx
"Well, it depends on how well we've played.",ans,ans,xxx
"What happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the other one still laugh?",q,q,xxx
"Of course, yes, yes, with all his might.",ans,ans,xxx
That's serious enough.,o,o,sad
"No.  No it isn't.  That's very laughable, a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.",dag,dag,xxx
Darling I believe you're talking nonsense.,o,o,xxx
"Oh, and who isn't talking nonsense?",o,o,xxx
Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers hmmm?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like quite idiotic school children.,o,o,xxx
Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come kiss me darling before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,o,o,xxx
"Elliot, worms don't pop.",s,s,xxx
"I don't care what you do, you see?  As long, no I don't care what you do, see?",o,o,xxx
You can put green paint all over your body and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.,o,o,xxx
Thank you dear.  The same applies to you...,o,o,xxx
...only if you ever so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.,o,o,xxx
Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,q,q,xxx
Which particular one?,q,q,xxx
The one when you bought a little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed.,ans,ans,xxx
"Charles, that was his name, Charles.  Oh, God he was so wiggled so beautifully.",s,s,xxx
Horrible little thing.,o,o,xxx
Yeah.  I know you did.  You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,ag,ag,xxx
I hated it.,o,o,xxx
How long did that rile last?,q,q,xxx
It went on intermittently for days.,ans,ans,xxx
"Oh, the worst one was in Cannes when you-",s,s,xxx
I burnt a hole in my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,s,s,xxx
you're curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown.,s,s,xxx
That was a rouser wasn't it?,q,q,xxx
[LAUGHTER] Yeah.  That was the first time you ever hit me.,ans,ans,xxx
I didn't hit you very hard.,o,o,neu
"The manager came in and saw us rolling on the floor, scratching and biting like panthers.",s,s,xxx
I will never forget his face. Ooh-rah [LAUGHTER].,s,s,xxx
"How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",o,o,xxx
We were very much younger then.,s,s,xxx
And much sillier too.,o,o,xxx
The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.,s,s,xxx
Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.,s,s,neu
"Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that.",dag,dag,neu
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,s,s,xxx
Presents?  A trivial little broach.,s,s,ang
Mmm Hmm.  I remember it well.  Bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.,s,s,xxx
Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.,dag,dag,xxx
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,s,s,ang
No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.,dag,dag,neu
You must admit he was in love with you.,c,c,ang
Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.,ag,ag,neu
You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it?,q,q,ang
Well what of it?,q,b,xxx
"Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me.",s,s,neu
And what about me?,q,q,ang
"Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you would've never known anything.",ans,ans,xxx
"Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.",o,o,ang
"Look, I'm bored with this conversation.",o,o,xxx
"Yeah, so am I.  Bored stiff.",ag,ag,ang
You want some brandy?,q,q,neu
No thanks.,ans,ans,xxx
I'll have a little I think.,s,s,neu
I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,s,s,ang
No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.,s,s,ang
I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.,o,o,ang
Oh my...just because I just...okay...,b,b,ang
...having three small minute liquor glasses in the evening is hardly going on and on and on.,o,o,xxx
It's become a habit with you.,o,o,neu
You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.,o,o,ang
Don't be so stupid.,o,o,xxx
Really Amanda.,dag,dag,fru
What?,q,q,ang
Nothing.,ans,ans,fru
[BREATHING],oth,oth,xxx
Going out somewhere dear?,q,q,fru
"No, just making myself beautiful for you.",ans,ans,neu
That reply has broken my heart.,s,s,xxx
That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you?,o,o,neu
Actually that's perfectly true.,ag,ag,neu
No it isn't.,dag,dag,xxx
Yes it is.,dag,dag,neu
"Oh, be quiet.",c,c,xxx
I think you should have some more brandy...,o,o,xxx
I think that,ag,ag,neu
...cause really,s,s,xxx
it doesn't seem to be working on you.,o,o,xxx
"perhaps maybe you should've had more brandy, it might've made you a little less disagreeable.",o,o,xxx
Well it really hasn't worked wonders with you.,o,o,xxx
"Hmm, snap, snap, snap like a little adder.",o,o,xxx
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",dag,dag,ang
Yes they do.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,dag,dag,xxx
They sting.,dag,dag,ang
They snap.,dag,dag,fru
I don't care.  I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they roll around and bark like hoops.,o,o,xxx
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,q,q,xxx
"Yes, I did.  Quite a lot.",ans,ans,xxx
I suppose you let him kiss you a great deal more then?,o,o,xxx
Mind your business.,c,c,ang
"Mmm, you must've had a riotous time.  No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.",o,o,xxx
You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.,o,o,ang
I'm not in the least bit drunk.,dag,dag,ang
You've always had a weak head.,o,o,ang
"Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.",o,o,ang
"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy.",o,o,ang
"Oh, what an interesting topic.  What about a child of four and a child of six?  A child of nine?",q,q,ang
Shut up.,c,c,ang
We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.,o,o,ang
"Not very funny dear.  In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy.",o,o,ang
"Oh, thanks.  I think I will.",ag,ag,ang
You better turn that off.,o,o,ang
Why?,q,q,xxx
Because people upstairs will get annoyed.,ans,ans,xxx
There aren't any people upstairs.  This is a photographer's studio.,s,s,xxx
Well there are people downstairs I suppose.,q,q,xxx
They are away in Tunis.,ans,ans,neu
"Oh, this is no time to be in here for Tunis.",o,o,xxx
"Turn it on again, please.",c,c,fru
No I'll do no such thing.,dag,dag,ang
Very well.  If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.,dag,dag,ang
"Come on, turn it off.  It's driving me mad.",c,c,ang
You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,o,o,ang
Turn it--Turn it off.,c,c,ang
Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.,c,c,ang
Very amusing indeed.,dag,dag,ang

I did exactly what they told me to do.,s,s,ang
I have done everything everyone in this entire place has told me to do.  I've been here for over an hour.  They make me wait in line.  Every single time I start over again.,s,s,fru
Ma'am I can't help you.  Do you understand?,q,q,fru
I have a life.  I have things to do.  I have places to go.  Can you not just put this through please?,s,s,fru
I've got a life too ma'am,s,s,ang

There's nothing I can do for you.  Do you understand that?  Nothing.,s,ans,ang

You're going to have to go back again.,s,s,ang
Okay.  What is it that I did wrong on the form that I have to start all over again?,q,q,ang
This whole area here you didn't initial,ans,ans,xxx

"Okay.  Well, I can do that right here right now without going to the back of the line again.  See look initialed.  All done. Ready to go.",s,s,ang
Ma'am I have other people waiting in line right now.  I have other people waiting in line right now.,s,s,ang
I have been waiting for over an hour.,s,s,fru
This whole area of the form was not supposed to be filled out and you put the address in the wrong place,s,s,fru
"Uhh, and you spelled your own name wrong.  So I need you to take that",s,s,fru
I'm not starting over again.  No I have done this five times.  I am not starting over again.,s,dag,ang

Look can you not just help me?,q,q,fru
I can't help you right now.  Do you understand that?,ans,ans,xxx
I mean look she's -she's perfectly nice.  She doesn't mind waiting for a couple of minutes because I've been here all day. I have a job to get back to.  I have kids to pick up from school.  I can't just stay here.,s,s,ang
Look I'm going on my lunch break right now.  So you're just going to have to take this form and go to the back of the line.,s,s,xxx
No.  No.  No. No. You have to help me.,c,c,xxx
like I said before right now.,s,s,ang
This is your job is to help people like me who need to get a new license.,o,o,ang
That's like the whole purpose of you being here.,o,o,xxx
Ma'am you are testing my patience.  Do you understand me?,o,o,fru
I- I- I'm testing your patience?,q,q,xxx
You're testing my goddamn patience.,o,o,ang
I'm testing your patience?,q,q,ang
"I work in this fucking building all day. And I'm sick of it, okay?",o,o,ang
Yeah.  You have to be here all day.,o,o,xxx
I don't need to be.  I need to go and do other things with my time.  Okay.,s,s,ang
"Please just put the form in, take the picture, let me get my license and get the hell out of here.  Please.",c,c,ang
I've walked away already.  I'm not here anymore.,s,s,xxx
So you're leaving tomorrow.,q,q,sad
Yeah.  They just called.,ans,ans,sad
This is really-this is unfair.,o,o,sad
I know.,ag,ag,sad
I don't see [BREATHING],s,s,fru
I don't know what to say.  I don't want to go but I don't have a lot of choice.,o,o,sad
"I mean we both knew that this was going to happen.  It's just that I feel that, you know, I don't want Susie growing up without a mother.",o,o,fru
"And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back.",o,o,sad
I'm going to come back.  I need you to believe that.,dag,dag,sad
You don't know that.,dag,o,fru
I need you to believe that too.  How am I supposed to believe everything's going to be okay if you don't?,q,q,xxx
"I'll believe it, but- I'll believe it but it- I don't know that that's going to happen.",ans,ans,fru
Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.,o,o,sad
You do have a choice.  You don't have to go.,dag,dag,xxx
Do you think I want to leave you?,q,q,sad
You have a choice.,ans,ans,fru
I have to do this.  I don't want to leave.  Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up?,q,q,sad
I know.  It's just you don't have to do this for a living you know.,ans,ans,fru
You're a smart person.  There are other things you can do.,o,o,fru
Look we both knew what this meant when I signed on,s,s,fru
And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.,ans,o,sad
I mean I'm the one who has to leave here.  I'm the one who has to leave the two of you.  At least you get to be together.,s,s,fru
It's just not going to work out without you here.,o,o,xxx
What's that supposed to mean?,q,q,sad
I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here.,ans,ans,sad
Well I'll come back.  What is that supposed to mean?  You're not willing to wait for me to come back?,q,q,ang
Of course I'm going to wait.  I just- I just don't like the idea of this happening because this isn't the last time this is going to happen. You're going to go on more tours and stuff.  I just- I can't-,ans,ans,fru
I can't deal with this emotionally.,o,o,fru
What do you want me to do?,q,q,fru
I want you to leave.  I want you to leave the service.,ans,ans,fru
Well I can't very well do it today.  I still have to leave tomorrow.,o,o,fru
You can do it today.  You don't have to do anything.  You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.,dag,dag,fru
"You're not making this any easier for me, you know.  I'm the one who has to go and you're really not helping.",o,o,fru
Look I'm just telling you that you don't have to go.,s,s,fru
I do have to go. And I need to know that you're here waiting for me and that you believe that I'm coming back.,dag,dag,fru
That's all I'm saying... No you don't.,dag,dag,ang
Thanks that helps.,g,g,ang
It's just really unfair.  This is- this is bullshit.,o,o,fru
I feel much better now.,o,o,ang
"You're acting like, you know, you're the one who's going all through, you know, all this shit and it's really- it's really not.",o,o,ang
I know I'm leaving you here with all the responsibility but at least you get to be with her.,o,o,fru
Yeah.  Of course I do because I didn't enlist in this stupid thing.  Why don't you just get out now and then-,ag,ag,ang
I will but I can't right now.,s,s,fru
Yes- You don't have to go.  What are they going to do?  Huh?  Put a gun to your head?,dag,dag,xxx
You know- you know how this works.  I have to go.,dag,dag,xxx
Then go.  We'll be here when you get back.,ag,ag,fru
That's how you want to leave it?,q,q,ang
"I don't know how else to leave it.  What, do you want me to lie to you?",q,q,sad
You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?,q,q,sad
I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be.  I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here.,ans,ans,sad
Well I can't be okay with it the same way you can't not go.  It just doesn't work that way.,o,o,sad
Fine.,ans,b,sad
It's really exciting.  Don't you want to guess?,q,q,exc

Thanks. Thanks a lot.  You're really helping the Excitement here. I hope no one dies.,o,o,exc
"Well no, I am- I'm trying to be positive",o,o,xxx
I'm trying to be positive.  I'm trying to say I hope that doesn't happen.,o,o,xxx
"Okey Well- well-, you know what?  I was hoping that you would help",s,o,exc
We're going to be in the middle of the wilderness. These kind of things happen,o,o,xxx

It's a wedding.,ans,ans,xxx
"It's a light brown, tanish.",s,s,neu
Blue for the sky.,s,s,xxx
Come on.,s,s,xxx
I just think browns are really what you want to go with.  I mean I think there's more contrast between brown and green than there is-,o,o,neu
who- Who's getting married though?,q,q,xxx
I know but you just asked me to-,ans,ans,neu
to help plan because I'm getting married. [LAUGHTER],s,s,xxx
So we're going to go greens and browns.,o,o,xxx
No.,ans,dag,xxx
"Come on.  Please will you do the greens and browns, just the browns for me?",q,q,fru
Just for me.  Come on.  I'm your best friend.,s,s,xxx
It's not your wedding. You can-,s,s,xxx

Give me the browns.,s,s,xxx
"You can't ruin my mood today.  If you want to wear a brown tux, you go ahead and wear a brown tux",s,s,xxx

"Throw in a little- little, uh, trim in yellow.  Maybe some yellow flowers.",ans,ans,exc
"Okay.  That sounds good. Um, and, uh, we're going to get like a five, uh, story cake, right?",q,q,neu
"Yeah.  I hadn't actually thought about the cake yet, but",ans,ans,xxx
"I mean, you know, you're going to have at least, like, two hundred and fifty people come.  So we're going to need, you know, just a huge buffet.",s,o,neu
Yes.,ans,ag,exc
"Fried chicken, mashed potatoes.",s,s,neu
See this is why you have to help.,o,o,xxx
because you're going to take care of everything.  You're going to think of all the details that I forget.,o,o,exc
Well I can't be in charge of this.  I mean I got things I got to do.,dag,dag,neu
Well right but you can help.,s,s,xxx
Well this is really exciting.  I mean- I just- I couldn't be happier right now.,o,o,exc
I'm thrilled.  God.,o,o,exc
Ha ha ha.,b,b,exc
Ha ha.,b,b,exc
Just ecstatic.  I can't believe you're my best friend,o,o,exc
Just couldn't be any cooler.,o,o,exc
"You're my best friend, we're growing up and now you're getting married. that's amazing",o,o,exc
I know.  I've been waiting forever.  I can't believe it's finally happening.,o,o,exc
Wow.  I just- I- I- I feel like I'm going to faint.,o,o,exc
I'm so- all the blood,o,o,exc
You don't look like you're going to faint.,o,o,exc
"has just rushed to my head, and I, and I mean honestly.",o,o,exc
I'm getting a little weak in the knees.,o,o,exc
So- So when are you getting married Mr. Excited?,q,q,exc
"You know that I've never-I- I have a long run of bad relationships but, you know, I mean, you got to work through it.  It's fine.",ans,ans,xxx

"I don't know.  Okay.  I mean gosh.  There's just- look there's a lot of pressure in getting married, okay.",o,o,neu
What?  She could be just as excited as I am right now.,o,o,xxx
You could make her that excited.  You really like her.  You guys have been together for a really long time now.,o,o,exc
"Oh, I've made her that excited.",ag,ag,xxx
[LAUGHTER] That's more than I needed to know.,s,o,exc
What?  You've heard me talk about it before.,s,s,xxx
[laughter],oth,oth,exc
I'm a monster in bed.,o,o,xxx
Hey.  Get out of the way.  I'm watching TV.,c,c,xxx
That's helpful.,o,o,neu
I just don't think I can do this anymore.  It's been a really long time and it's not like I'm not trying.,o,o,fru
Well I guess you're not trying hard enough.,o,o,neu
I am try-  it's been three years,s,dag,fru
and I have gone everywhere I can think of.  I have given resumes.  I have done interviews.  I've tried to pull in favors.  I've asked everybody I know for help.  I don't know what else to do.,s,s,fru
"Just, I don't know, maybe you're not smart enough.",o,o,neu
I mean I don't know just go out and keep trying. Just-,o,o,neu
I don't know.,s,o,neu
"Okay but I've been trying for three years.  Three years and I haven't gotten a bite much less actually gotten hired, and I am smart enough.  Thank you very much.",s,s,fru
"Hey.  Look, I mean- you know.",s,c,neu
I'm really good at what I do.  I just don't know how to make someone else see that.,o,o,ang
Look bananas don't grow overnight.  Okay.,o,o,neu
What?  Who says that?  Bananas don't grow overnight.,q,q,ang
You need that- Time-,s,s,neu
"You know- You need to just- you need, I mean it takes time to get a good job.  I mean-",o,o,neu
Okay.  I think three years is a little excessive.,o,o,fru
"look at me, like, you know. I mean, Hey, I- it took me, you know, like six years to get where I am now. I mean-",s,s,neu
"Yeah but you weren't unemployed for three years trying to find any job.  I mean at this point I'm going to go drive a cab or, you know, work at the gas station or something.  I don't even- I don't know what to do anymore.",s,s,ang
I don't know.  I mean whatever.,s,s,fru
Nothing I'm trying seems to work. Just-,s,s,fru
Clearly.,ag,ag,xxx
Okay that's helpful.  Thanks.,o,o,xxx
Look I'm sorry okay. It's just-,ap,ap,xxx
Clearly everything you're doing is completely wrong.,o,o,ang
"I mean, well I mean i don't know; it doesn't really affect my life, you know.",o,o,neu
Well don't you understand that this is-,q,q,fru
"Yeah, I understand, but-",ag,ans,neu
I don't even- I mean you have to have some kind of an idea.  Something you could possibly throw out there that I could maybe use.,o,o,ang
"I don't know. Well like, I don't know. I mean-",s,s,neu
I mean it's not like this is an,o,o,ang
extreme request.  I want to find a job.  Everybody wants to find a job. It's really not that.,o,o,ang
Clearly- cle- clearly you're doing something wrong.,o,o,neu
"Okay. Okay, Fine.",ag,ag,ang
"Cause if you've been looking, you've been applying for jobs for three years. And-",s,s,neu
Okey So I'm doing something wrong.  What am I doing wrong?,q,q,ang
I'm really good at what I do.  I'm smart.  I'm trained.  I have the education.  I'm talented.  I cannot-,o,o,ang
Are you- I mean do you like get dressed up and everything when you go to the job interview?,q,q,neu
Well yeah I mean I like take a shower and stuff.,ans,ans,fru
"And you like- you know, you shave your legs and everything?",q,q,neu
[LAUGHTER] Yeah.  Usually.,ans,ans,fru
"and I want- I mean you know you've got to, like, do your hair.  I mean- I don't know, it's like,",s,q,neu
"Yeah, I- I make my",ans,ans,fru
I make myself very presentable before I go to any kind of interview.,s,s,fru
"you know what I mean? You know, it's like they say presentation is, like eighty percent.",s,o,neu
or some- some large percent of- of success.,s,s,neu
"Uhuh. Uhuh. Yeah, yeah. Good quote.",ag,o,fru
"Because I don't know I mean just, you know, just keep- keep- keep at it.  Keep trying.  Go-",o,o,neu
Buck-O. That's really helpful.  Just keep chugging along.  The little engine that could.,o,o,fru
"What do you want me to? Look, Hey look if I could- Don't get all sassy.",c,c,xxx
Well you- just you're doing something wrong.,s,s,ang
"Look if I could give you a job,if I could give you a job I would but I mean I'm not in that position. I'm-",o,o,fru
Well maybe you could help.  I mean you've got a job.  I'm willing to look outside of my realm.  I could try something else.,o,o,fru
"Hey, I'd love to help you but I- you don't have the kind of training that I-",o,o,neu
I'll get it.  I just need a job.  I don't care what it is.,o,s,fru
"So, go to McDonalds.",o,o,fru
Well I mean I need to make a little bit more than the minimum wage fry flipper.,o,o,fru
Well you've got to start somewhere.  I mean-,o,o,neu
I did start somewhere.  I worked my way up.  I'm not going to start at the bottom again.,s,s,fru
Well you're going to have to.  You don't really have an option.  What's your problem?,q,q,fru
What's my problem?  What's my problem? I don't have a job.,ans,ans,ang
I don't know it's like I'm trying to be-,s,s,neu
I thought I was pretty clear about what the problem was.,o,o,ang
I'm trying to be helpful.,o,o,neu
"I'm trying to be helpful and you're just, like, coming at me with, like, attacks.",o,o,xxx
Well maybe you could be a little helpful.  I mean obviously you don't have any problems so would it really take so much time out of your day to just go ahead and help somebody else.,o,o,fru
I'm trying to watch TV.,s,s,neu
I'm trying to watch TV. TV.,s,s,xxx
That's important.  That's really important.,o,o,fru
Where?  Did you do it at the front desk or by the baggage claims?,q,q,fru
"I-I don't know.  The place where they told me to go.  Look they told me to come talk to you because you guys lost my bag.  Not it's late.  Not it will be here soon, lost it completely.  What are you going to do about that?",q,q,fru
"Ma'am, first of all I'd like you to calm down.  Second of all-",ans,ans,fru
Look that bag has my entire life in it and you just lost it.,s,s,fru
I understand that ma'am.,ag,ag,xxx
"Lost it just, like, I mean,",s,s,ang
"Ma'am, I understand that.",ag,ag,fru
it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention,o,o,ang
"because my bag was very easy to keep track of.  It's got big, you know, rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it's just gone.",s,s,ang
"I understand that.  The best I can do for you, at this moment, is give you fifty dollar check courtesy of Northwest Airlines for inconveniencing you in losing your luggage.",s,s,fru
Wait.  What?,q,q,sur
"At this moment in time, all I can do for you is give you-",ans,ans,fru
No. No. I heard- I heard what you said.,s,s,ang
"You're kidding me, right.  You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through.  I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up.",s,s,ang
you're getting very excited right now,o,o,fru
"Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it.",s,ag,ang
"I understand that, ma'am but there's not really much I can do for you right now.",s,s,fru
Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.,s,s,ang
What I need you to do is file another complaint form. There's a form that you can fill out over by the front desk near the baggage claim.,s,s,fru
If you'd like to take that over to the front desk- Ma'am.,s,s,fru
We're just talking over each other.,s,s,fru
We're not going to communicate anything this way.,s,s,fru
I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it.,o,o,ang
Ma'am in flying with Northwest Airlines you agreed to,s,s,fru
sign away your luggage to the,s,s,fru
I didn't sign anything. I didn't sign anything. And you people have got to make-,dag,dag,ang
"It's part of the small- it's part of the agreement when you're purchasing an airline ticket, there's- when you-",ans,s,fru

"Yeah, I know. But I'd rather have him here with me, you know. It's just not fair.  I mean he- he didn't get to do like anything. I mean he was-",o,o,sad
"He was only twenty four and just so many things that we were going to do, you know, and now he won't get to do them and he won't get to be here when I do.  You know, like I'll get married some day and he won't be there, like, he won't get to see that.",o,o,sad
Yeah.,ag,ag,sad
It just doesn't seem fair.,o,o,sad

You're okay,q,q,sad
Thank you for being here.,g,a,sad

"I mean it's not really free because you have to pay for it, but yeah.",o,o,neu
Well do you think you're going to live on campus or off campus your first year?,q,q,neu
"I think I'll live on campus the first year cause you  meet more people that way, right?",ans,ans,xxx
"Oh, yeah? In a dorm?",q,q,xxx
"Well, yeah.  I mean that's where you meet people, right.  Everybody lives in the dorms, right.",ans,ans,xxx
"I hate to break this to you but you meet people by being cool, so-",o,o,neu
"Oh, oh, I'm sorry, my bad.  I'll have to, like, sign up for summer lessons from you before I go.  You can teach me how to be cool before I go to college.",o,o,exc
"No, no, no.  You're right though.  I mean, you know, dorms are definitely the way to meet people.  I know that I was in an apartment off campus",ag,ag,neu
"and I mean, you know, I knew my roommates and stuff but I there wasn't really that sense of community-",s,s,xxx
Right.,ag,ag,xxx
"that happened, you know, that was going on.",s,s,neu
So basically what you're saying is that I was right,q,q,xxx

"I asked for no tomatoes on six tacos.  I got tomatoes and onions on all of them,",s,ans,xxx
"Um, hairs were found in three out of the six.",s,s,xxx
"Did you try to take them back and get your order fixed, sir?",q,q,fru

"It was a hundred a sixty dollars.  I'm sorry, uh, sixteen dollars.",s,s,neu

"Look, I don't want to be transferred over to another- All I want to do is just give you my name and address so you can send me a check.",dag,dag,ang
"Okay.  You understand that's all I want. Just don't give me a problem with this.  Okay, please because I'm very sensitive right now",s,s,ang
"and if I get sent to another operator, I'll have to tell them the same damn story again.  I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind.  So if you could please just not do that, that would be great.  Thank you.",o,o,ang
"I understand, sir.  I will explain to them what the situa-",s,s,fru
You don't understand because you've never gone to Del Taco and gotten the service that I've gotten.  You don't understand.,s,dag,ang
You're right sir.  It is your particular situation but I will call the other operator.  I will explain to them what's going on. You won't have to tell your story again.,s,s,xxx
You're not going to call the other operator. You're not going to call the the other operator.,s,s,ang
You're going to fill out a form on your desk,s,s,ang
because I know you're at a desk right now in your stupid corporate building and you're going to send me a check for sixteen dollars and forty two cents.,s,s,ang
"Okay, sir.  They- they have to-",s,s,fru
Sir.,b,b,fru

I will go ahead and I will take- I will take,s,s,fru
"Hey, Cindy. Cindy, look I know this is not your fault.  Do whatever you want.",s,s,fru
Send me to whatever operator. I just- You know what?  I'm just done.  I'm just done.  I've lost all hope.,o,o,fru
"Sir, customer satisfaction is our first goal.  I will go ahead and take your number and your address down myself.",s,s,xxx
"of getting my sixteen dollars back. It fine, no honestly.",o,o,fru
"No, Cindy just don't even-look don't even.  Cuz I- look Cindy I know you don't care about me, okay.  I know that I'm just like another person who calls-",s,s,fru
Wait. But I-,c,c,xxx

"Okay.  If that's what you want, you want to go to the next person?",q,q,fru
Yes.,ans,ans,xxx
Okay.  Great.,a,a,fru
What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.,o,o,xxx
He saw it.,s,s,neu
When?,q,q,xxx
About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked.,ans,ans,xxx
Did you talk to him?,q,q,sad
"No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.",ans,ans,sad
What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.,q,o,fru
I guess he is.,ag,ag,xxx
"I don't know the meaning of this, mom.  But I know one thing you made a terrible mistake with dad.",ans,ans,fru
What?,q,q,sur
"Being dishonest with him, that kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.",ans,ans,fru
What do you mean dishonest?,q,q,xxx
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,q,q,ang
"What do you want to do, argue with him?",q,q,ang
I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.,ans,ans,ang
"Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?",q,q,xxx
You can't say that to him.,ans,ans,ang
We've got to say it to him.,c,c,ang
How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?,q,q,ang
For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.,ans,ans,ang
To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?,q,q,ang
Sit down mom.  I want to talk to you.,c,c,fru
The trouble is the goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry.,s,s,ang
"Alright, alright, alright.  Listen. You know why I asked Annie here don't you?",q,q,fru
Why?,q,q,xxx
You know why.,q,ans,neu
Well I got an idea but what's the story?,q,q,xxx
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,ans,ans,neu
"Well that's only your business, Chris.",o,o,neu
You know it's not only my business.,dag,dag,fru
What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,o,o,ang
Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.,s,s,fru
Well you want to make sure that father isn't going to-,s,s,xxx
Then it isn't just my business.,s,s,ang
I'm just saying.,s,s,fru
Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.,o,o,ang
Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.,o,o,ang
I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.,s,s,ang
She's not Larry's girl.,dag,dag,fru
"From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl.",s,s,ang
"Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?",q,q,ang
"I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life time after time after time.",o,o,fru
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.,o,o,neu
To hell with that.,dag,dag,ang
Did you ask Annie yet?,q,q,xxx
I wanted to get this settled first.,ans,ans,sad
How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.,q,q,fru
"Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.",ans,ans,fru
"and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me.",c,c,ang
The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,o,o,fru
So what I'm not fast with women.,s,ag,ang
I don't see why it has to be Annie.,s,s,ang
Because it is.,s,s,ang
Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.,s,s,ang
I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her.,s,s,xxx
"These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",q,q,sad
"I don't want a diagram.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.",ans,ans,fru
You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?,q,q,ang
Alright then mom.,a,a,xxx
Just give it some more thought.,c,c,xxx
"I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry",s,s,ang
"and everything would be happy and we would have a regular wedding.  But if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.",s,s,fru
What the hell is this?,q,q,xxx
"I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else, maybe New York.",ans,ans,xxx
Are you crazy?,q,q,ang
I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker I'm through with it.,ans,ans,xxx
You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?,q,q,ang
"The business, the business doesn't inspire me.",ans,ans,ang
Must you be inspired?,q,q,ang
"Yes, I like it an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening I want it beautiful.",ans,ans,fru
I want- I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I give myself to.  Annie is in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?,s,s,fru
You mean-tell me something you mean you'd really leave the business?,q,q,fru
Yes on this I would.,ans,ans,xxx
Well you don't want to think that way.,o,o,xxx
Then you help me stay here.,c,c,fru
Alright but don't think that way,s,s,ang
"because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris.",s,s,ang
I know.  Just you help me stay here.,ag,ag,fru
But don't think that way.  You hear me?,q,q,ang
I am thinking that way.,ans,ans,xxx
I don't understand you do I?,q,q,xxx
No.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,ans,ans,xxx
Yeah.  I can see that.,ag,s,ang
Why did he invite her?,q,q,ang
Why does that bother you?,q,q,neu
It's been three years.  Why all of a sudden?,q,q,ang
Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again.,ans,ans,neu
Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.,c,c,xxx
She's not going to marry him.,c,c,xxx
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,q,q,neu
It's got that about it.,ans,ans,xxx
Listen kid.,c,c,fru
"No, line.",dag,dag,ang
"Uh, Then why is she still-she's not his girl, Joe",o,o,neu
"She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",o,o,ang
Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.,ans,ans,ang
How do you know why she waited?,q,q,fru
Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.,ans,ans,ang
"In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",o,o,fru
Look it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?,q,q,fru
"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might but not his father, not his brother.",o,o,fru
What do you want me to do?,q,q,fru
"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",ans,ans,xxx
But Kate-,b,b,fru
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.",o,o,fru
"Laugh, laugh at me, but why did that happen the very night she came back?",s,s,xxx
"She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look, look at it.  Joe-",s,s,ang
Calm yourself.,c,c,fru
"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",s,s,fru
Calm yourself.,c,c,fru
Just last week a man showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.,s,s,fru
Alright.  Alright.  Calm yourself.,c,c,fru
You above all have got to believe.  You.,c,c,fru
Why me above all?,q,q,fru
Just don't stop believing.,ans,ans,fru
"What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking.",s,s,ang
I can't help it.,o,o,fru
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is matter with you Kate?,q,q,fru
You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,s,s,xxx
I know it went out of style didn't it?,q,q,xxx
It's okay.  It's a good thing.,ans,ans,xxx
You know it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.,o,o,xxx
You're not sorry you came.,q,q,xxx
"Not sorry, no but I'm not staying.",ans,ans,xxx
Well.,b,b,xxx
You saw that and you- you've been kind of-,s,s,xxx
What?,q,q,ang
Well kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.,ans,ans,xxx
The trouble is I planned on sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so but they take it for granted that we're all set.,s,s,xxx
"I knew they would, your mother anyway.",ag,ag,xxx
Wouldn't you want to?,q,q,xxx
I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.,o,o,neu
I guess this is why I came.,o,o,hap
"Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",o,o,hap
I have no imagination that's all I know to tell you.,s,s,hap
I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I,s,s,hap
"wanted some place we'd never been, a place where we'd be brand new to each other.",o,o,xxx
"You think this is wrong, this chair, this yard.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",o,o,xxx
"Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.",s,s,hap
And he's gone forever.  You're sure?,q,q,neu
I almost got married two years ago.,ans,ans,xxx
Why didn't you?,q,q,xxx
You started to write me.,ans,ans,hap
You felt something that far back?,q,q,xxx
Every day since.,ans,ans,hap
"Ann, why didn't you let me know?",q,q,xxx
"I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say.  I mean you sure can be ambiguous you know.",ans,ans,hap
"Give me a kiss, Ann.  Give me a-God I kissed you.",c,c,hap
"I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",o,o,hap
I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,o,o,hap
"Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",o,o,hap
Not like that you're not.,o,o,xxx
I kissed you.,s,s,xxx
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.",o,o,xxx
What is it Chris?,q,q,xxx
Let's drive some place.  I want to be alone with you.,s,ans,xxx
"No.  What is it Chris, your mother?",q,q,xxx
"No, nothing like that.",ans,ans,sad
Well then what's wrong?  Even in your letters there was something ashamed.,q,q,xxx
Yes.  I suppose I have been but it's going from me.,ans,ans,sad
You've got to tell me.,c,c,xxx
I don't know where to start.,s,s,fru
It wouldn't work this way.,s,s,xxx
There's so many things mixed up.,s,s,sad
You remember overseas I was in command of a company?,q,q,sad
"Yeah, sure.",ans,ans,neu
Well I lost them.,s,s,sad
How many?,q,q,sad
Just about all.,ans,ans,sad
"Oh, gees.",b,b,xxx
It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.,o,o,sad
"For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.",s,s,sad
I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.,s,s,sad
They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.,o,o,sad
"And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made",o,o,sad
a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?,q,q,sad
And then I came home and it was amazing.,s,s,sad
There was no meaning in it here.,o,o,xxx
The whole thing to them was sort of a bus accident. Then I went to work with father and that whole rat race again.,s,s,xxx
"I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",s,s,sad
because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.,s,s,sad
"I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.",s,s,sad
I mean you can take those things out of war but,o,o,xxx
"when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.",o,o,sad
Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.,o,o,sad
I guess that included you.,o,o,sad
And do you still feel that way?,q,q,xxx
"I want you now, Annie.",ans,ans,xxx
"Because you mustn't feel that way anymore because you have a right to whatever you have, Chris, do you understand, everything",o,o,xxx
that includes me.  And your money there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.,o,o,xxx
You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.,o,o,xxx
"Annie, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.",o,o,hap
What'll I do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.,q,q,hap
"Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid to miss it.  How you doing?",q,q,xxx
Fine.,ans,ans,neu
"Is that, is that-that's just foam isn't it?  I can't even tell",s,s,exc
"although if you can't tell, it probably isn't them.  It will probably be unmistakable.  Don't you think?  How you doing?",q,q,xxx
"Oh, no you know what I did?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid I forgot my flashlight.",s,s,fru
What flashlight?,q,q,xxx
"The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?",ans,ans,fru
It's ours.  It's mine too.,ans,ans,xxx
Well sure.,ag,ag,fru
You kept saying my flashlight as if it somehow is just yours.  How's that supposed to make me feel?,q,q,xxx
"No of course our flashlight, yours and mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?",ans,ans,fru
I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon.  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?,q,q,exc
Yes.,ans,ans,xxx
"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.",s,s,neu
"Ah, this is great, isn't it?  I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.",s,s,hap
I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.,o,o,xxx
"Oh, I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?",q,q,xxx
I'm cold.,s,s,xxx
Do you want my jacket?,q,q,xxx
It's after eleven let's go home.,s,s,ang
Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?,q,q,fru
There is no point in coming down here.,ans,ans,ang
Right.,ag,b,fru
That's my point.,s,s,fru
That's my point too.,ag,ag,neu
So let's go home.,c,c,fru
"No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?",q,q,fru
Not particularly.,ans,ans,fru
Why not?,q,q,xxx
I just don't.  It's stupid.,ans,ans,ang
Honey this is natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year.  This is a great opportunity.,s,s,fru
Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.,s,s,exc
"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die.",s,s,ang
"Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that.",s,s,fru
This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.,o,o,exc
What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.,o,o,ang
"Yeah, they do.",dag,dag,fru
"Oh, Augie.",b,b,fru
Okay but it's fish who do something none of the other fish do,s,s,fru
"like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic",s,s,exc
a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you cannot be interested.,o,o,fru
I'm just not.,s,s,ang
For real?,q,q,sur
Yes.,ans,ans,ang
I don't get it.  The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.,s,s,fru
Last year you will also remember our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got in a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the Grunions.,s,s,xxx
We weren't in a good spot.,o,o,fru
We didn't see them the first time either.,s,s,ang
We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.,o,o,ang
"I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there. What's that.  Is that?  Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it.",q,q,exc
"Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.",c,c,exc
Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.,s,s,exc
No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.,s,s,exc
They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.,s,s,exc
It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.,o,o,exc
They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place,s,s,exc
where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.,s,s,exc
"Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.",s,s,exc
That's the wind.,s,s,fru
Well so what do you think?,q,q,xxx
About what?,q,q,ang
What I said.,ans,ans,xxx
It's ridiculous.,o,o,ang
"Well, so what do you think?",q,q,neu
About what?,q,q,xxx
What I said.,ans,ans,xxx
It's ridiculous.,o,o,xxx
It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,dag,dag,xxx
It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,o,o,ang
I'm not the only one.  Look at these people.,dag,dag,xxx
"Well sure everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us all excited, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action.",o,o,xxx
Are we talking about the same thing?,q,q,xxx
Well I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.,ans,ans,xxx
"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way but are you having your period?",q,q,xxx
Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.,ans,ans,ang
Well then what's bugging you?,q,q,fru
We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.,ans,ans,ang
"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",s,s,fru
"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",s,o,ang
Why not?,q,q,fru
We totally skipped. Right.,ans,ans,neu
"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do the little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",s,s,xxx
"For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.",o,o,ang
Why not?,q,q,fru
We never do.  Do we have we ever?,q,q,ang
We've missed them twice that's not ever.,ans,ans,fru
Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.,s,s,ang
We'll see them this year.,o,o,fru
"No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Clause.",dag,dag,xxx
"God I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up,",o,o,xxx
and the fish won't show up.,s,s,ang
I thought you wanted to see it.,o,o,fru
You don't understand anything I'm saying.,s,s,fru
"No, of course not.",dag,dag,fru
I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is.,o,o,fru
It's just a fish.  Nothing to get traumatized over.,o,o,fru
"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",s,s,xxx
I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.  You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.,s,s,fru
Let's see I took a shower.  You watched the news.  You said the Grunions are running tonight. I said great let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.,s,s,xxx
"Okay.  Uh, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals.  We're getting the car out of the garage.",s,s,xxx
Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.,s,s,xxx
We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes,s,s,sad
"and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me",s,s,sad
right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.,s,s,sad
"And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",s,s,sad
Wait a minute.  I've got it.,c,c,neu
"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.",s,s,sad
"It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?",q,q,neu
"That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it.",ans,ans,exc
I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.,ans,o,sad
Okay.  Right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen you want to dance?,q,q,xxx
No.,ans,ans,neu
You want me to get some champagne?,q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,sad
Take off our shoes?,q,q,xxx
No.  No.,ans,ans,fru
Well what?  Want me to breath in your ear?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,fru
Want to get married again?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,fru
What?  What do you want a divorce?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,fru
A vacation?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,ang
"A new carpet, a poodle, a backrub, ice cream, a suicide pact.  What?  What?  Carla what the hell do you want?",q,q,fru
I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.,ans,ans,xxx
Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind.,o,q,xxx
"Do you think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish.",q,q,fru
Do you think that I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex and times I would look at you and think holy hell when's the next flight to Alaska.,q,q,fru
"No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our",o,o,fru
"Sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha, ha baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get,",o,o,fru
"you know what you get Carla, this.",s,s,xxx
"This what, what is this?  This isn't even anything.",s,s,ang
Yes it is.,dag,dag,xxx
"Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",o,o,ang
Right.,ag,ag,xxx
But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,o,o,xxx
"No, I know me either.",dag,dag,xxx
"This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot in everything but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",q,q,xxx
I'm doing the best I can.,ans,ans,fru
"I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",ag,ag,sad
Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,o,o,sad
I didn't say that.,dag,dag,fru
"No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy.",ag,ag,sad
"For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.",o,o,fru
Yeah?,q,q,sur
Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else,ans,ans,fru
somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.,o,o,sad
"Actually now that you mention it, no I don't.",dag,dag,neu
Okay.  Fine.  So we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.,o,o,xxx
I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.,o,o,neu
I mean look at the view you've got of the moon from here.,s,s,xxx
"Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon.",o,o,hap
Well look at what we got here.,s,s,exc
"Oh, Augie you brought refreshments.",s,s,hap
It's not champagne.,s,s,neu
Well then I guess we don't need glasses.,s,s,hap
You still cold?  Do you want to go home?,q,q,xxx
I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this may be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry.,ans,ans,hap
"Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",o,o,xxx
Or not.,o,o,xxx
Or not.,o,ag,xxx
I wonder.,ans,ans,fea
Nobody knows we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.,s,s,xxx
It must be them then.,s,s,fea
Well what are we going to do?,q,q,xxx
"We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?",s,s,xxx
Now and always sweet.,ag,ag,xxx
I don't care then.,s,s,xxx
It was bound to come sooner or later.,s,s,xxx
Hello.  Hello.  What?  Wrong number.,s,s,xxx
Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine.,s,s,exc
What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,q,q,exc
Behave exquisitely.,ans,ans,exc
With the most perfect poise.,q,s,exc
Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.,ans,ag,exc
"Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?",q,q,exc
What is so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,ans,ans,xxx
"Don't say that, my darling.",c,c,neu
It's true the whole business is very poor joke.,o,o,exc
Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love.,q,q,xxx
"Yes, meaning just that.",ans,ans,xxx
What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God what does it all mean?,q,q,xxx
Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,c,c,exc
"You mustn't be serious, my darling.  It's just what they want.",o,o,xxx
Who's they?,q,q,neu
All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.,ans,ans,xxx
"Laugh at them, be flippant, laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths",o,o,xxx
flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,o,o,xxx
"If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too.",o,o,xxx
Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun alright.,ag,ag,xxx
"Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours?",q,q,exc
Well who knows?,ans,ans,neu
We always want to bicker and fight.,o,o,xxx
No that fire will fade long with our passion.,dag,dag,xxx
"Oh, dear shall we like that?",q,q,xxx
It all depends on how well we've played.,ans,ans,xxx
What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left still laugh?,q,q,neu
Yes.  Yes.  with all his might.,ans,ans,xxx
"Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",q,q,xxx
"No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.",ans,ans,xxx
"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",o,o,xxx
So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.,o,o,xxx
Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can like small quite idiotic little school children.,o,o,xxx
Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,o,o,xxx
"Elliott, worms don't pop.",s,s,xxx
"I don't mind what you do, see. you can paint yourself green all over",o,o,xxx
and dance naked in the place Place Vendome and rush away with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.,o,o,xxx
"Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",o,o,exc
Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?,q,q,neu
Which particular one?,q,q,exc
The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.,ans,ans,neu
"Oh, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles he did wriggle so beautifully.",s,s,exc
Horrible thing.  I hated it.,o,o,neu
"Yes, I know you did.  You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.",ag,ag,exc
How long did that row last?,q,q,neu
It went on intermittently for days.,ans,ans,xxx
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.,s,s,neu
It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,s,s,exc
"Ah, we were much younger then.  That was a rouser wasn't it?",q,q,xxx
That was the first time you ever hit me.,ans,ans,xxx
You didn't hit me- I didn't hit you very hard.,o,o,xxx
Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,s,s,exc
I shall never forget his face.,s,s,xxx
"How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",o,o,exc
We were very much younger then.,s,s,xxx
And very much sillier.,o,o,exc
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",s,s,xxx
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",s,s,neu
"There was nothing in that, you know that.",dag,dag,xxx
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,s,s,ang
Presents a trivial little broach.,s,s,xxx
I remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.,s,s,xxx
Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.,dag,dag,xxx
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,s,s,ang
I did not.  You made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,dag,dag,xxx
"You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?",q,q,xxx
"Just a little perhaps, nothing serious.",ans,ans,xxx
You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,s,s,ang
What of it?,b,q,ang
What of it?,b,b,ang
It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,s,s,xxx
What about me?,q,q,ang
"If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",ans,ans,xxx
"That's a nice point of view, I must say.",o,o,ang
"Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.",o,o,fru
So am I.  Bored stiff.  Want some brandy?,q,q,xxx
No thanks.,ans,ans,fru
"I'll have some myself, I think.",s,s,neu
I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,s,s,xxx
No particular reason.  Anyway they were very small ones.,s,s,xxx
seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,o,o,xxx
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on.,o,o,fru
It's become a habit with you.,o,o,ang
You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment.,o,o,xxx
"Oh, don't be so stupid.",o,o,ang
"Really, Amanda.",dag,dag,ang
What?,q,q,ang
Nothing.,ans,ans,ang
"Going somewhere, my dear?",q,q,ang
Just making myself fascinating for you.,ans,ans,fru
"Ah, that reply has broken my heart.",s,s,xxx
The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute will you.,o,o,fru
"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",ag,ag,xxx
"Oh, no it isn't",dag,dag,fru
"Yes, it is.",dag,dag,xxx
"Oh, be quiet.",c,c,xxx
It's a pity you don't have anymore brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,o,o,xxx
It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,o,o,ang
"Snap, snap, snap like a little adder.",o,o,fru
Adders don't snap they sting.,dag,dag,ang
Non-sense they have bags of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,dag,dag,xxx
They sting.,dag,dag,ang
They snap.,dag,dag,xxx
"I don't care, okay.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.",o,o,ang
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,q,q,neu
"Yes, I did quite a lot.",ans,ans,ang
I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.,o,o,xxx
Mind your own business.,c,c,ang
"You must have had a riotous time.  No restraint at all, very enjoyable, you never had much anyhow.",o,o,xxx
You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.,o,o,ang
I'm not in the least drunk.,dag,dag,ang
You always had a weak head.,o,o,ang
I think I mentioned once before that I had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.,o,o,fru
"On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",o,o,ang
Very interesting and how about a child of six and a child of four and a child of nine.,q,q,xxx
"Oh, shut up.",c,c,ang
"They'd get up a splendid little debate about that, you know.  Intemperate tots.",o,o,xxx
"Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.",o,o,ang
Very good idea.  I will.,ag,ag,ang
You'd better turn that off I think.,o,o,xxx
Why?,q,q,ang
It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs.,ans,ans,xxx
There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,s,s,ang
There are people downstairs I suppose.,q,q,ang
They're away in Tunis.,ans,ans,xxx
This is no time of year for Tunis.,o,o,ang
"Turn it on again, please.",c,c,xxx
I'll do no such thing.,dag,dag,xxx
Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,dag,dag,ang
Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,c,c,ang
You're far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,o,o,ang
Turn it off.,c,c,xxx
"Go away, go away.  I hate you.",c,c,ang
"Amanda, listen.",c,c,ang
Listen? Listen indeed.  I'm sick and tired of listening to you.  You damn sadistic bully.,o,o,ang
Stop.,c,c,ang
Very amusing.,o,o,ang
"Stop, stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",o,o,ang
"You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast. And I hope I never see you again as long as I live.",o,o,ang
"This is the end do you understand?  The end,",s,s,ang
You're not going like this.,c,c,ang
finally and forever,s,s,ang
"Oh, I am.  Let go of me.",dag,dag,ang
You're not.,dag,dag,ang
"Oh, I hate you. It's a good thing that I found out in time what you're really like. Marry you again?  Never, never, never.",o,o,ang
Shut up.  Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.,s,s,ang
"You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore.",o,o,ang
I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine.,o,o,ang
"Yeah, hi.  Um, look, I -- all I'm trying to do right now is renew my license plate.  That's all.  I just need to get one of those little stickers.",s,s,neu
Okay.  What's the problem?,q,q,neu
"And I've- I've- some lady -- I got in line.  I waited for about two hours um, and, I gave her this form",ans,ans,fru
"that she gave to me earlier. And she said oh, I gave you the wrong one by accident.  So I was hoping I could just fill out a new one, give it to you and sort of skip this whole line business.",s,s,fru
"Okay, um.  Do you have your photo ID with you?",q,q,neu
"Yes, I do.",ans,ans,neu
Okay.  This is the wrong form.  I'm sorry.,s,s,neu
"This is -- okay, then just can I have the form that I need.",q,q,fru
"I don't have the form.  You're going to have to go get in that line over there and they will give you the right form.  And after you fill it out, you can bring it back to me.",ans,ans,fru
Don't you -- you don't have-,s,s,fru
are you telling me you don't have a stack of them behind the desk?,q,q,fru
I don't have any of,ans,ans,fru
I don't have any of them over here.  You're gonna have to go get in that line over there.  And they will give you a copy of the form.,s,s,fru
"But you're -- it's the same -- I mean, you can -- like I can't go behind your desk--",s,s,fru
"Nope, I don't. I don't have-",dag,dag,fru
or I can't go behind there- you can go behind this person's desk and just grab the form. So if you could just do that; that would help me out a lot.,s,s,fru
"No, I can't. That's-",dag,dag,fru
I'm sorry.  You have to do things the way you have to do things here.  We have rules.,s,s,fru
"Look, can you please just-- --make this -- look, I look--",q,c,fru
"Go get in that-- Sir-- Sir, there are people in line behind you. you need",s,s,fru
look-- It's  been- it's been two hours.  Can you please just make this easier on me and just go and get the form?  It's not- it's really not,q,q,fru
"I'm sorry.  I'm sorry you're having a hard time,",ap,ap,fru
but you're gonna have to go get in  that line to,s,s,fru
What if I pay you money?,q,q,fru
"Can I pay you money?  Can I give you, like, twenty bucks and you'll go back there and get the form?",q,q,fru
twenty bucks? Please. Go get in that line over there.,ans,ans,neu
"Come on.  Will you please?  I just --I look, I  cannot-- --just if I --",q,q,fru
"Look, I'm having a really bad day.  I'm off in twenty minutes and I just really don't need this right now, okay.",s,s,fru
"I don't care, well- You're having a bad -- I just waited in line for two hours.",s,s,fru
"And you're gonna have to go wait again, because that's the line you need.",s,s,fru
Well I just -- I can't do that right -- can you please just grab the form? All you have to do is grab the form.  I'm not gonna ask anything else of you.,s,s,xxx
I can't do that. It's against our rules. You can go get in that line over there or you can just go ahead and leave and come back another day.  Maybe there will be a shorter line.,o,o,fru
That's all I- I just- That's all i want you to-,s,s,fru
"Rules, you just have to grab a piece of paper behind from somebody's desk",s,s,fru
It's not rocket science.,o,o,ang
"Come -- just, please, just grab the form.  It's right over there.",s,s,fru
I can't do that.,dag,dag,fru
I know it's right over there.,s,s,xxx
Why are you being such a bitch?,q,q,fru
"I'm sorry, but I can't do that.",ap,ap,fru
"Please, will you please -- will you please just grab the form?",q,q,fru
So go get in the other line or leave.  Or I will have you escorted out by security.,s,s,ang
Would you like to be kicked out of the D.M.V.?  You don't think that'll be a little embarrassing?,q,q,ang
"Fine, which line is it?",q,q,fru
The one you just came from.,ans,ans,fru
"Okay, fine.  I'll go over there.  Thanks, a lot.  You've been really helpful.",o,o,ang
Yeah.  Thank you.  Have a pleasant day.,g,g,ang
There's really -- there's nothing I can do.,s,s,xxx
You're just fine with this?,q,q,xxx
There's nothing I --,s,ans,fru
You're just going to pick up and leave me and our baby and miss a year of our lives?,q,q,fru

Don't go.,c,c,xxx
I can't do that.  I have to go.,dag,dag,fru
"Do you want to -- do you want to leave us behind?  I mean, I don't understand why you have to do this.",q,q,fru
I've made a pledge.  I can't not do this at this point.,ans,ans,fru
I'm not going to stay more than a year.  I've  agreed to a year,ans,ans,fru
Then why do you have to go a year at all?,q,q,fru
Well unagree.  Tell them that you can't leave right now.  I can't do this by myself.  I can't do this without you.,c,c,fru
"Yes, you can.  Yes, you can.  You know you can.  You're a strong person.",dag,dag,fru
This is supposed to be a partnership.  We're supposed to do this together. I'm not supposed to be left here to do this by myself while you leave.,o,o,xxx
It is. It is. It is. It is. I'm going to write you every day.,ans,ag,fru
"What am I supposed to do, read your letters?",q,q,xxx
What else can we do?  I -- we don't have a choice in this.  Do you understand?  You can't come with me and I can't stay here.  That's all there is to it.,o,ans,fru
"There has to be something.  I mean, we can't just live with this.  It's not -- it just won't work this way.",o,o,fru
We don't have a choice.  I have to do this.,dag,dag,fru
Just tell them no.,c,c,fru

"Then, can't you please try something?  If you go and ask them and they say no, then I would understand, but you're not even willing to ask.",q,o,fru
Can't you just make an effort?  Can't you just try?,q,q,fru
I've asked already.  I can't go back.,ans,ans,fru
"It can't happen.  I have to go.  I want to stay really bad, but I can't.  There's just no -- I don't have an option.",o,o,fru
When do you leave?,q,q,sad
Next week.,ans,ans,fru
A week.  You're giving me a week to be okay with this.,ans,q,ang
"You can't make it out like I'm happy about this.  I mean, I didn't -- I didn't want to put you in this situation.",o,ans,fru
Well it doesn't seem like you're that bothered by it.,o,o,fru

"If you really cared so much, you'd find a way out.",o,o,fru
There's nothing I can do.  I-- I,s,s,fru
"Fine, fine.  We have to be together.  If you can't stay here, then I'll go with you.  I don't care where you go.  We'll go, too.  I'm not staying behind.",o,o,xxx
They won't let you come along.  It's not going to happen.,dag,dag,fru
"It's a free world.  I can go where I want.  Wherever you are, that's where we're going to go.",o,o,fru
Are you kidding? Please don't be difficult about this.,o,q,fru
Difficult.  You're leaving for a year. We have a newborn child and you're leaving.  I don't think I'm being difficult.,ans,ans,xxx

You're not really giving me a lot of options.,o,o,fru
Where I'm going is not the safest place on the earth.  Okay.,o,o,fru

Well that's good.  It'll be a great wedding.  You're willing to compromise on things.,o,o,xxx

She's going to let you have say in the wedding choices?  That's pretty impressive. Very forward-thinking woman. [LAUGHTER],o,o,xxx

And brown.,oth,oth,xxx
All fruit and the color brown. Just that. That's all- that's my only request.,s,s,hap

All fruit and brown. [LAUGHTER],s,s,exc

What about like a temp agency?,q,q,neu

"I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it.",o,o,neu
"Yeah, I do.  I do.  You don't understand.",ag,ag,fru
I- You don't understand. I don't have a job.  All- My job is to look for a job.  I don't do anything else.,o,o,fru
"No, no, no, no, no.  I can't- I can't do that.  I can't, I- because if I'm not- if I'm not- if I'm not doing something that I love, then I can't -- I can't- I mean it's- what's the point?",q,dag,fru
"Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really.",q,o,neu
I'm not choosing. I'm not-,dag,dag,fru

"Well maybe, you know, your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while.",o,o,neu
This is stupid.,o,o,fru
"I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know--",s,s,neu
"You know what, this is your fault.",o,o,fru
Excuse me?,q,q,sur
It's your fault 'cause -cause you always told me to- to do this and I did that instead.  And I didn't take your advice and - and- but you sort of were like were telling--,ans,ans,fru
It's my fault 'cause you didn't do what I told you to?,q,q,neu
"Yeah, exactly.",ans,ans,fru
Well that sounds like your fault.,o,o,neu
Yeah.,ag,ag,fru
You didn't do what I told you to do.,s,s,neu
That's 'cause you always tell me to do the wrong thing.  And I thought this time it was -- I was gonna be right by going with the opposite thing. So it's your fault because,o,s,fru
"-because you were always wrong and-and-and this time you were right. And-and I didn't -- yeah, that's why.",o,o,fru
That's amazing logic that you managed to turn that around and make it my fault.,o,o,xxx
"Well, I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it, hmm?",q,q,neu
I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions.,o,ans,neu
That's not true.  I take responsibility for my own actions.,dag,dag,neu
Really?  Whose fault is it you don't have a job?,q,q,neu

No.  No.  No.  What I need you to do -- I need you to write checks for -- I need you to write three of them. That'll be satisfactory.,dag,dag,ang
We only cover fifty do-,s,s,fru
"Just -- you can fill out the form--We can fill out - no, no, no, we can fill out the form three times.",s,dag,ang
We only cover fifty dollars worth of lost items.,s,s,fru
And then that'll be that. It's going to be fine. Just-,s,s,fru
"I'm going to get very upset.  Like, I mean, I'm- I'm upset right now but I'm going to get really upset if you- if you don't do the check thing.",o,o,xxx
I'm very sorry.,ap,ap,fru
I'm very sorry.  I understand you're upset.  You just got off a long flight.,ap,ap,neu
"You don't understand. You don't understand, actually.  You don't understand because it was my luggage that was lost.  Okay.",dag,dag,fru
"Yeah.  If it was yours, but it's not. It's mine.  Okay. So just--",s,s,ang
But it's not.  It's yours.  I understand.,ap,ap,neu
I know.  We want to work with you.  We will give you the fifty dollars but I'm--,s,s,fru
"No, it's not going to be -- but it's not going to be fifty, it's going to be a hundred and fifty.  You're going to write three, you understand, three of- of the forms.  You're going to write three of them out and then give it to me.",s,dag,xxx
"Yeah, we don't do that.  I can go ahead and send you--",dag,dag,fru
You- you- you- you're misunderstanding me.  You're going to do that.,c,c,fru
"We will definitely keep an eye out for your bag. We will try to find it.  We will, you know, fill out the form for missing items.",s,s,fru
"Look, can I just -- can I speak to your manager, please?  'Cause I- I really -- I don't, um -- I mean, I just don't want to deal with -- I know that -- I mean, I know this isn't your fault,",q,q,fru
No one can make the three check thing happen 'cause we don't do that.,ans,ans,fru
I can write you the one check.,s,s,fru
but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen.,s,s,ang
All- all that my supervisor could do is the exact same thing that I'm offering to do.,s,s,fru
"But what I'm talk -- but I'm just,just- please let me--",s,s,fru
But if I could just speak directly -- if I could just speak directly to your-- to your superior person,o,s,fru
"I'd be happy to give you a cup of coffee, too.",o,o,fru
We'll just throw that in--gratuitously.,o,o,fru
then that would be helpful to me because I just feel like if- you don't think you have the power to write three checks but you actually do. see?,o,s,fru
"No, I don't. See, I could lose my job if I did that.",o,o,fru
But your job is not my concern. My concern is getting my luggage.,o,o,fru
And your bag is not my concern.,o,o,fru
The fifty dollars I'm going to give you for your bag is really all I'm concerned with.,s,o,fru
"Look, I don't -- look, can we just not argue about this.  Like--",q,q,fru
I'm more than happy to not argue about it.  I will give you your fifty dollar certificate.,s,ans,fru
You can go ahead and go fill out the form. We'll look for your bag.,s,s,fru
So what if- what if we- what if we do three forms,q,q,fru
with different names on them? That-,q,q,fru
Then that would be lying.,ans,ans,fru
"but, no. See, 'cause",s,s,fru
if we have three forms then I can get the hundred and fifty.,s,s,fru
I'm sorry.  We can only issue one fifty dollar certificate to cover the lost bag for one person.,ap,s,fru
"Just please, will you please just work with me here? Just -- all I'm asking you to do is just work with me. I know -- I know that you get lots of people all day long who give you shit, give you crap, but",s,s,fru
"I understand you're frustrated, but--",ag,ag,neu
"um, you know, I -- this is my bag and I need the hundred and fifty dollars. Please.",s,s,fru
I know. I understand it's personal-- It's personal to you. I get that.,ag,ag,neu
Please.,dag,c,ang
"But if you want to just sit down, you know, maybe have a cup of tea, calm down a little bit, we'll go ahead and we'll do what we can for you. you okey",s,s,fru
"I'm already calm. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm.",s,s,ang
"Just all I need you to do is just fill out three forms and I'll leave you alone forever, forever.  I'll never -- we'll never see each other again.",s,s,fru
"And I'm looking forward to that.  However, I can't do that. I would lose my job.",o,dag,fru
But that's not going to-- But you don't understand. You're looking forward to never seeing me again.,o,o,fru
"Oh, yes.",ag,ag,fru
But never seeing me again is not going to happen until you give me the three checks.,o,o,fru
"I'm sorry, really.  But--",ap,ap,fru
I don't -- I'm not- I'm not convinced.,o,o,fru
That I'm sorry?,q,q,fru
"Yeah.  If you were really sorry, you'd give me the three checks.",ans,ans,ang
"So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm?",q,q,ang
"Hey, how you doing?",q,q,sad
"I know- I know there's nothing I can say that will really help, but--",o,o,sad
"I know.  I just -- I don't know.  It's just weird because you have somebody who's, you know,",o,o,sad
a major part of your life and then they're gone.  And I don't know.  That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before.,s,s,sad
"But, I'm here if there's anything you need.  I mean, you just have to ask.  I know --",s,s,sad
Thanks.,g,g,sad
--it doesn't really do anything.  But--,o,o,sad
I just -- it's just not fair.,o,o,sad
I know.  It never is.,ag,ag,sad
feel the same way everybody else does.,o,o,sad
"I mean, what do you want to do?  Do you want to- do you want to talk about it?  Do you-",q,q,sad
"[BREATHING] I mean, there's nothing really to talk about.  He's gone and I'll never see him again.",ans,ans,sad
"Well I know it's not a lot of help or anything, but at least you got to know him.  I mean, at least you had the time with him that you did.",o,o,sad
Yeah.,ag,ag,sad
"I mean, we can be grateful for that.",o,o,sad
"Yeah, I don't know.  Sometimes I wish I didn't know him.  So I wouldn't--",o,o,sad
This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand.,o,o,sad
"Just life, in general?",q,q,xxx
"I mean, it's just not fair.  Like, I don't know.  Why people -",q,ans,sad
"there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected.",o,o,sad
"I agree.  If I knew how to make that happen, I would certainly help you.",ag,ag,sad
I don't know what to do.,s,s,sad
"When's the service? Can- can we help?  Is there anything, I mean--",q,q,sad
"I mean, you- you can go.  I don't know.  I don't know what else.",ans,ans,sad
I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.,o,o,sad
"Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be.",o,o,sad
Yeah.,ag,ag,sad
I just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically.,o,o,sad
I know.,ag,ag,sad
"Just, you know, some thing; some genie. I need to find a genie bottle.",o,o,sad
"I don't have any magic answers.  But,",s,s,sad
"I mean, as- as cliche as it is, as long as people who loved him remember him, then it's not a waste, you know.",o,o,sad
I know.,ag,ag,sad

No. Football's boring.,ans,ans,xxx
"Just one game, though?  I mean, for the experience.  I mean, you don't have to go to all of the games but you gotta go to a game.",s,q,xxx
I'll go to basketball games.,ans,ans,neu
"Okay.  Well that's cool, too, but like--",o,o,neu
Maybe some golf matches.,s,s,neu
"Wow, you are a winner and a half. [LAUGHTER]",o,o,exc
Do they even have any golf matches? I don't even know.,q,q,xxx
I don't know.  Do they have golf?  Do they have- Does U.S.C. have a -- I don't know if they have a golf team.,ans,ans,neu
I don't know. Women's volleyball.,ans,o,xxx

Basically anything women do.,o,o,xxx

So can you please refund the mischarged charges,q,q,fru
So you're saying that you didn't make these calls.,q,q,neu
I did not make the calls from B.F.E. Nebraska.,ans,ans,fru
"Well I mean, I'm supposed to use discretion in the situation and, um--",s,s,fru
So could you discretion it back?,q,q,fru
All I can do for you right now is give you a hundred dollars.,ans,ans,neu
of the money that I was charged that I didn't make those calls.,s,s,fru
What I can do for you is give you a hundred dollars right now and fill out complaint form,s,s,neu
which you- which you'll have to go into a local Verizon dealer--  or Sprint.,s,s,neu
"Okay, no, look, I- I- I- I'm really -- I'm trying to be patient.  I know this isn't your fault.  I know that you didn't do it",s,s,fru
"but, at the same time, I have been through an hour of little robot voices telling me what I needed to do.",s,s,fru
"Ma'am, I understand that.",ag,ag,fru
And I did everything they said.  And now i'm talking to you and you're supposed to put the money back on my account because I didn't make the calls and I'm really tired of dealing with this because I didn't even,s,s,xxx
"Ma'am, I - I - I understand that. I understand that. What I can do for you right now is what I'm telling you is that I can do- I can give you a hundred dollars back and then you'll have to fill out a complaint form and then you'll get -- there'll be some investigation. Some men will show up at your house and go through your things.",s,s,fru
Excuse me?,q,q,fru
A few weeks.  You won't even know that they were there.,ans,ans,neu
I have to wait a few weeks for people come go through my things to get the money back that I didn't spend?,q,q,fru
"Okay.  You know what?  I just don't feel like doing this anymore.  Um, you can have all the money back, two hundred dollar, right now.",ans,ans,fru
Really?,q,q,sur
"Yeah.  That's fine.  I just -- that's fine. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make any difference to me.  I mean, it's not like it's going to cost my job or anything.",ans,ans,neu
You're just going to put it back on my account.,q,q,neu
"I mean, technically, that's policy.  But, like, I mean, I don't really care about -- nobody really cares about policy here.",ans,ans,neu
So you're just going to take care of this for me?,q,q,sur
Sure.,ans,ans,neu

What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.,o,o,neu
He was out here when it broke.,ans,ans,neu
When?,q,q,sur
About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked.,ans,ans,xxx
Did you talk to him?,q,q,xxx
No.  I - I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.,ans,ans,xxx
He cried hard?,q,q,xxx
I heard him right through the floor of my room.,ans,ans,xxx
What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.,q,o,xxx
"I don't know the meaning of it, mom.  But I know one thing; we made a terrible mistake with dad.",ans,ans,fru
What?,q,q,sur
Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,ans,ans,xxx
"What do you mean, dishonest?",q,q,fru
You know that Larry's not coming back.  And I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,q,q,xxx
What do you want to do?  Argue with him?,q,q,fru
I don't want to argue with him but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore.,ans,ans,fru
You can't say that to him.,ans,ans,ang
We've gotta say it to him.,c,c,ang
How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?,q,q,ang
"For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.",ans,ans,ang
"To you it is and to me, but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body and no grave, so where are you?",q,q,ang
"Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",c,c,xxx
"The trouble is the Goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere, so the next boy is going to be Larry.  So we have to keep--",s,s,xxx
"Alright, alright, alright.  Listen.  You know why I asked Annie here don't you?",q,q,fru
Why?,q,q,neu
Going to ask her to marry me.,ans,ans,neu
"Well that's only your business, Chris.",o,o,neu
You know it's not only my business.,dag,dag,fru
What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,o,o,ang
Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it?,s,s,xxx
Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have --,s,s,neu
"Well, then you know it's not only my business.",s,s,ang
I'm just saying.,s,s,fru
"Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.",o,o,ang
I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.,s,s,ang
She's not Larry's girl.,dag,dag,fru
Now what can I do for you?,q,q,fru
"I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time after time.",o,o,fru
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.,o,o,xxx
To hell with that.,dag,dag,fru
Did you ask Annie yet?,q,q,xxx
I wanted to get this settled first.,ans,ans,neu
How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.,q,q,neu
"Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  We'll find out.  Then we'll thrash it out with dad. Right, mom?  Don't avoid me.",ans,ans,xxx
"The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did.",o,o,neu
So what?  I'm not fast with women.,ag,ag,xxx
I don't see why it has to be Annie.,s,s,ang
Because it is.,s,s,fru
"Well that's a good answer, but it don't answer anything.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know?  Because I don't.",s,s,xxx
"Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom.",q,q,neu
Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?,q,q,neu
"Yeah, let's keep going.",ans,ans,neu
Just give it some more thought.,c,c,neu
I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that if,s,s,fru
"father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out.",s,s,sad
What the hell is this?,q,q,ang
I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else.  Maybe New York.,ans,ans,xxx
Are you crazy?,q,q,ang
I've been a good son too long; a good sucker.  I'm through with it.,ans,ans,fru
You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?,q,q,ang
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ans,ans,ang
Must you be inspired?,q,q,ang
"Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.",ans,ans,ang
I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?,s,s,xxx
You mean -- tell me something.  You mean you'd really leave the business?,q,q,xxx
"Yes, on this I would.",ans,ans,neu
You don't want to think like that.,s,o,ang
Then you help me stay here.,c,c,neu
"Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you.",s,s,ang
I know that.  Just you help me stay here.,ag,ag,fru
"But don't think that way, you hear me?",q,q,ang
I am thinking that way.,ans,ans,xxx
"I don't understand you, do I?",q,q,xxx
"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",ans,ans,fru
"Yeah, I can see that.",ag,s,xxx
Why did he invite her here?,q,q,ang
"Why does- why, does that bother you?",q,q,xxx
"She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden--",q,q,ang
"Well, maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her.",ans,ans,xxx
Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.,c,c,xxx
He's not going to marry her.,c,c,ang
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,q,q,neu
It's got that about it.,ans,ans,ang
Well so what?,q,q,neu
"Now listen, kid. Now, listen.",c,c,neu
"Oh.  Now listen, kid.",c,c,xxx
"She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",o,o,ang
You can't read her mind.,o,o,xxx
"Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.",o,o,ang
How do you know why she waited?,q,q,xxx
"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.",ans,ans,ang
What do you want me to do? What do you want?,q,q,fru

"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.",o,o,ang
Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here?,s,s,ang
She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--,s,s,ang
Calm yourself.,c,c,fru

Calm yourself.,c,c,fru

Why me above all?,q,q,fru
Just don't stop believing.,ans,ans,xxx

I can't help it.,o,o,sad
"What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",q,q,ang
You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,s,s,xxx
So you're not sorry you came?,q,q,xxx
"No, not sorry, but I'm not going to stay.",ans,ans,xxx
Why?,q,q,xxx
What?,q,q,xxx
"I knew they would, your mother, anyway.",ag,ag,xxx
How did you know?,q,q,xxx
I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.,o,ans,xxx
I guess this is why I came.,o,o,xxx
"Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",o,o,xxx
I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.  I'm embarrassing you.,s,s,xxx
I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted someplace we'd never been; someplace where we'd be brand new to each other.,o,s,xxx
"You think this is wrong, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",o,o,xxx
"Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.",s,s,xxx
Why didn't you?,q,q,xxx
You started to write me.,ans,ans,xxx
You felt something that far back?,q,q,xxx
Every day since.,ans,ans,hap
"Anne, give me a kiss.  Give me a -",c,c,xxx
"I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've waited to kiss you.",o,o,xxx
I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,o,o,hap
I kissed you.,s,s,xxx
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it, Chris?",q,q,xxx
Let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.,ans,s,xxx
"No, what is it, Chris?  Your mother?",q,q,xxx
"No, no, nothing like that.",ans,ans,xxx
"Then what's wrong.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed.",q,q,xxx
"Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me.",ans,ans,sad
You've got to tell me.,c,c,xxx
I don't know where to start.,s,s,sad
It wouldn't work this way.,s,s,xxx
"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",q,q,sad
How many?,q,q,sad
It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.,o,o,sad
"For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",s,s,sad
They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.,o,o,xxx
"And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,",o,o,sad
a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible.,o,o,sad
"There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",s,s,sad
because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;,s,s,sad
"to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.",o,o,sad
"You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you.",o,o,sad
And do you still feel that way?,q,q,xxx
"And your money, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",o,o,xxx
"Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune.",o,o,hap
What'll I do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
"What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here; couldn't be better.",o,q,xxx
"Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?",s,s,exc
"How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight.",s,s,exc
What flashlight?,q,q,xxx
Whose is it?,q,q,neu
"It's ours.  It's mine, too.",ans,ans,ang
"Well, sure.",ag,ag,fru
You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?,q,q,ang
"No, of course, our flashlight; yours and mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight, naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.",ag,ans,xxx
"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.",s,s,neu
"Oh, man.  This is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Six pack would be just the ticket right about now.  I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.  Oh.",o,o,xxx
I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.,o,q,xxx
It's after eleven; let's go home.,s,s,ang
Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?,q,q,fru
That's my point.,s,s,fru
"That's my point, too.",ag,ag,neu
So let's go home.,c,c,ang
"No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?",q,q,fru
Not particularly.,ans,ans,fru
Why not?,q,q,xxx
I just don't.  It's stupid.,ans,ans,ang
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.",s,s,exc
"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die.",s,s,ang
What are you so excited about?,q,q,neu
"Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy.",ans,ans,exc
This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.,o,o,fru
"Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.",dag,dag,exc
There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested.,o,o,exc
I'm just not.,s,s,fru
"I don't get it.  First time we came here to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.  And last year, I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here, you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.",s,s,xxx
"Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.",s,s,ang
We weren't in a good spot.,o,o,xxx
"no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.",c,c,exc
Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;,s,s,exc
"just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.",s,s,exc
They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.,s,s,exc
"They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.",s,s,exc
That's the wind.,s,s,fru
Well so what did you think?,q,q,exc
About what?,q,q,fru
"Look at this, goose bumps.",c,c,neu
What I said.,ans,ans,neu
It's ridiculous.,o,o,xxx
Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,dag,dag,fru
Sure.  They're all told the same story.  It's what keeps us coming back for more; keeps us excited; keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we could just find the right spot; get in on the action.,o,o,xxx
"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way, but are you having your period?",q,q,fru
"Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.",ans,ans,ang
"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",s,s,ang
"For heaven's sake, we are not going to see the grunions.",o,o,xxx
Why not?,q,q,xxx
"We never do, do we?  Have we ever?",q,q,ang
We've missed them twice.,ans,ans,xxx
That's not ever.,s,s,xxx
Twice is every time we've tried.  That's ever.,s,s,fru
I thought you wanted to see them.,o,o,xxx
You don't have any idea what I'm saying.,s,s,fru
"No, of course, not.",dag,dag,fru
"I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.",o,o,ang
It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over.,o,o,fru
"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",s,s,xxx
"Uh,okay.  So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals;",s,s,fru
Uh.,b,b,fru
"It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.",s,s,sad

"Wait a minute, I've got it.",c,c,neu
Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.,s,s,sad
"It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.",o,o,neu
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,ans,o,sad
Sure.  Okay.  Alright.  I've got it.  Listen do you want to dance?,q,q,xxx
No.,ans,ans,sad
You want to get some champagne?,q,q,xxx
No.,ans,ans,sad
You want to get married again?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,fru

No.,ans,ans,fru
A vacation?,q,q,fru
I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.,ans,ans,ang
"Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.",o,o,ang
"No, I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and wind in our hair and sand in our toes and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves.",o,o,xxx
"And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",s,s,ang
This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,s,s,ang

I'm doing the best I can.,ans,ans,fru
"I know you are, Augie.  Really, I do.  I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything.  But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",ag,ag,fru

I didn't say that.,dag,dag,sad

Yeah?,q,q,sur
Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else; somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.,ans,ans,xxx

What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,q,q,exc
Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey.,ans,ans,exc

But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,ans,ans,exc

It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.,o,o,exc
"Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",q,q,neu

All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.,ans,ans,ang

Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright.,ag,ag,xxx
"How long will it last, this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours?",q,q,exc
Who knows.,ans,ans,xxx
Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,q,q,exc
No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,ans,ans,sad

But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh,s,s,neu
I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.,s,s,neu
"Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?",q,q,neu
"Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.",s,ans,neu
"Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?",q,q,fru
"Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?",q,q,neu
"Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.",ans,ans,fru
"Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?",q,q,neu
Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.,ans,ans,neu
And you couldn't find it?,q,q,fru
"No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.",ans,ans,fru
Are you sure?,q,q,neu
I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--,ans,ans,fru
"Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.",s,s,fru
Okay.,b,ag,fru
"All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?",q,q,neu
"Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--",ans,ans,fru
Sentimental value.,ans,s,neu
--really important stuff.,s,s,xxx
"Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.",s,s,neu
"That's not going to cut it. Like, Really, I really need to get this bag back.",o,o,xxx
"No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.",s,s,neu
Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?,q,q,fru
"Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?",q,q,neu
Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.,s,ans,ang
"Well,",b,b,neu
Obviously ma'am.,ag,ag,fru
"I am sorry, ma'am.",ap,ap,fru
"Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.",s,s,neu
"Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?",q,q,neu
"No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?",q,q,ang
"Well, if I knew that, then I'd know where it was, wouldn't I?",ans,ans,xxx
"Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.",o,o,ang
"Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?",q,q,neu
"Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.",o,ans,ang
That's what the cost of the ticket was for.,s,s,fru
"Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-",s,s,fru
"Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.",s,s,ang
"Right. Yes, ma'am.",ag,ag,fru
And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.,s,s,ang
"Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.",s,s,fru
"That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.",s,s,ang
"Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?",q,q,neu
No.,ans,ans,xxx
"Well, my hands are really tied then.",s,s,neu
Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?,q,q,fru
"Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--",s,ans,neu
"Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.",s,s,fru
"Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?",q,q,neu
Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.,ans,ans,fru
"Uh, so it was really heavy.",s,s,neu
"So I would have carried it on, but they made me check it and then they lost it.",s,s,xxx
"Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.",ans,s,fru
There's nothing else you can do?,q,q,fru
"I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.",ans,ans,neu
I don't believe that for a second.,o,o,ang
Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.,s,s,neu
"Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.",s,s,fru
"No, I don't think you are. I mean If you were doing everything you could, you'd either give me more money or you'd figure out where my bag is.",o,o,xxx
"Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-",s,s,neu
What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?,q,q,ang
makes up?,q,q,neu
You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-,s,s,ang
"The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.",s,ans,neu
You could go into the computer and- you know- print-,q,q,xxx
I've gone into the computer.  I told you exactly what I can see in the computer that your luggage did arrive here.,ans,ans,xxx
"So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?",q,q,fru
"Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.",ans,ans,fru
And you have no guarantee.,q,q,fru
"I have no guarantee, absolutely not.",ans,ans,fru
This is ridiculous.,o,o,fru
How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?,q,q,fru
"Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.",o,ans,fru
"Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?",q,q,fru
"Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.",o,ans,fru
"Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous",o,o,fru
"No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.",dag,dag,ang
Right.,ag,ag,neu
It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.,o,o,ang
"I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.",o,o,fru
"And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.",s,s,neu
okay fine.,ag,ag,xxx
So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?,q,q,neu
"Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.",ans,ans,fru
"Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.",s,s,neu
Thanks.,g,g,fru

yeah.,ag,ag,sad
That's the best way to put it.,o,o,neu
It's hard to say good-bye.,o,o,sad
Absolutely.,ag,ag,neu
[BREATHING],oth,oth,sad
"Do you know what, if it was me that died, I'd really want you to be crying and being really upset too any way. So, I think you should definitely do this, because it's trying what it's supposed to be.",o,o,neu

Are you taking the late fee off of my account then?,q,q,neu
"Um- I can try to do that for you, certainly.",ans,ans,neu
Because I paid it on time.,s,s,fru
"Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well.  So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer.  And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee, then you should just call back and we'll have that.",s,s,neu
Right.,ag,b,neu

I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.,ans,ans,sad

Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.,ans,ans,sad
"What do you mean, dishonest?",q,q,xxx
"You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?",ans,ans,sad
"What are you going to do, argue with him?",q,q,xxx
"No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.",ans,ans,fru
"Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?",q,q,fru
You can't just say that to him.,ans,ans,xxx
We have to say it to him!,c,c,fru

So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?,q,q,fru
Well you're want to make sure your father isn't you know going to--lose them,s,ans,xxx
Then it's not only my business.  Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?,o,o,xxx
"You know that?  Isn't it your business too, if I tell dad, and he gets, throws a fit about it?   you have such a talent for ignoring things!",o,o,xxx
I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.,s,s,fru
She's not Larry's girl!,dag,dag,xxx
"As far as your father is concerned, he's not dead and you've no right to take his girl.",s,s,xxx
"Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do.  I mean do you know what to do, because I don't.",s,s,fru
"I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time, after time.",o,o,fru
"Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.",o,o,neu
To hell with that!,dag,dag,ang
Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?,q,q,neu
I want to get this settled first.,ans,ans,xxx
"Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?",q,q,neu
"Well, if she does, then that's the end of it, but from her letters it sounds like she's forgotten about it.  I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with Dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",ans,ans,xxx
"The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have",o,o,neu
"So what, I'm not fast with women.",ag,ag,fru
Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,s,s,neu
Because it is.,s,s,fru
"well, that's a good reason, but it doesn't answer a thing.",s,s,xxx
"I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?",q,q,fru
"No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back.",ans,ans,fru
"You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.",s,s,sad
"All right, then, Mom.",a,a,fru
Give it some more thought.,c,c,xxx
"I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.",s,s,fru
What the hell is this?,q,q,ang
"I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York?",ans,ans,fru
Are you crazy?,q,q,ang
"I've been a good son for too long, a big sucker.  I'm through with it.",ans,ans,xxx
Wait a minute.  Tell me this.  Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?,q,q,fru
The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?,ans,ans,ang
Must you be inspired?,q,q,xxx
"Yes!  I like it an hour a day.  If I had to grub for money all day long, I like to come home to something beautiful.  I want a family.  I want- I want kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to. and Annie is in the center of that, and now where do I find it?",ans,ans,xxx
"Don't- you, you can't think like that!  Don't think like that!",s,s,fru
Then help me stay here.,c,c,xxx
"All right!  But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!",s,s,ang
I know that Mom. I know.  Just you help me stay here.,ag,ag,xxx
"All right, but don't think like that.",s,s,xxx
I am thinking like that.,dag,dag,xxx
"I don't understand you, do I?",q,q,fru
No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,ans,ans,xxx
"Yeah, I can see that.",ag,s,xxx
Why did you invite her here?,q,q,xxx
Why does that bother you?,q,q,neu
She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?,q,q,neu
Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.,ans,ans,neu
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,o,s,xxx
"What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.",q,q,neu
He's not going to marry her.,c,c,xxx
How do you know he is even thinking about it?,q,q,fru
It's got that about it.,ans,ans,xxx
"Well, so what.",q,q,fru
"What's going on here, Joe?",q,q,fru
"Now, listen, Kate, just-",c,c,fru
She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.,s,o,ang
You can't read her mind.,o,o,xxx
"She's . . . Then why is she still single.  New York is full of men, why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.",o,o,fru
How do you know why she's waited?,q,q,fru
Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.,ans,ans,fru
Look.  It's a nice day.  Why are we arguing?,q,q,fru
"Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith.  Strangers might, but not his father, and not his brother.",o,o,fru
What do you want me to do? What do you want--,q,q,fru
I want you to pretend like he's coming back!,ans,ans,ang
"But, Kate...",b,b,fru
"Because if he's not coming back, then I'll kill myself.",o,o,ang
[LAUGHTER],oth,oth,fru
"Laugh.  Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?",s,s,ang
Calm yourself.,c,c,fru
"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",s,s,xxx
Calm yourself!,c,c,fru
"Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.",s,s,ang
"All right, all right.  Calm yourself.",c,c,fru
"You above all, have got to believe, Joe.",c,c,xxx
"Why me, above all?",q,q,xxx
You've got to believe. You've got to--,ans,ans,sad
What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!,s,s,ang
I can't help it!,o,o,ang
"What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",q,q,ang
You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,s,s,hap
I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?,q,q,hap
"No, it's good.",ans,ans,hap
It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.,o,o,hap
So you're not sorry you came?,q,q,xxx
No.  But I'm not going to stay.,ans,ans,hap
Why?,q,q,sur
Well your mother has much as told me to leave.,ans,ans,xxx
Well--,b,b,xxx
"Well, you saw that! And you.  You've been-",s,s,xxx
What?,q,q,neu
Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.,ans,ans,sad
Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.,s,s,hap
I figured they would- your mother at least.,ag,ag,xxx
How did you know?,q,q,neu
"Well, from her point of view why else would I come?",ans,ans,neu
"Well, would you want to?  I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.",q,q,xxx
I guess this is why I came.,o,ans,hap
"Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you!",o,o,hap
"I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.",s,s,exc
"You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",o,o,exc
"Chris, I've been ready for a long time.",s,s,xxx
"Then, he's gone forever-you're sure?",q,q,xxx
I almost got married two years ago.,ans,ans,xxx
Why didn't you?,q,q,xxx
You started to write me.,ans,ans,xxx
You felt something that far back?,q,q,xxx
Every day since.,ans,ans,xxx
"Annie, why didn't you say something to me?",q,q,xxx
Well I was waiting for you!  I mean I didn't-until then you hadn't written and when you write- when you wrote what did you say?  I mean you sure can be ambiguous Chris.,ans,ans,xxx
"Give me a kiss, Ann. Give me a-",c,c,xxx
Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.,o,o,exc
I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you!,o,o,hap
"Oh Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",o,o,exc
"Not like that, you're not.",o,o,hap
I kissed you.,s,s,xxx
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  Chris, what's the matter?",q,q,hap
Let's Let's drive someplace.  I- I want to be alone with you.,s,s,xxx
"No, what is it, your mother?",q,q,xxx
"No, nothing like that.",ans,ans,xxx
"What is it?  Even in your letters, there is something ashamed.",q,q,xxx
"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",ans,ans,sad
I don't know how to start.,s,s,xxx
It wouldn't work like this.,s,s,sad
"It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-",s,s,sad
Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.,q,q,sad
yeah sure.,ans,ans,neu
Yeah.  I lost them.,s,s,sad
how many?,q,q,sad
just about all.,ans,ans,sad
Oh gee.,b,b,sad
Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-,o,o,sad
"for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.",s,s,sad
"I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.",o,o,sad
I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.,o,o,sad
"And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-",o,o,sad
"but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?",o,o,sad
And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.,o,o,sad
And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.,s,s,sad
"It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.",s,s,sad
And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and,s,o,sad
"It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!",s,s,sad
"And if you're not, then it's all just loot and it's got blood on it, and I don't want any of it!  And, I guess that included you.",o,o,xxx
Do you still feel like that?,q,q,neu
"I I want you now, Annie.",ans,ans,exc
"Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",o,o,sad
"Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!",o,o,hap
What would I do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
"What time is it?  Isn't it supposed to start running around midnight?  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this great night we got here.  Couldn't be better--",o,o,exc
actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing?,q,q,exc
Fine.,ans,ans,neu
"Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?  How you doing?",q,q,exc
"Oh no, you know what I did.  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.",s,s,exc
What flashlight?,q,q,neu
"The flashlight, the silver one, there's only one, isn't there?",ans,ans,fru
It's not your flashlight.,s,s,fru
Whose is it?,q,q,fru
It's ours- our flashlight.  It's yours and mine.,ans,ans,xxx
"Well, Sure.",ag,ag,fru
"I mean you keep saying ,my flashlight, as if it's somehow just yours.  How's that suppose to make me feel?",q,q,fru
"No, Of course, you are right.  Our flashlight.  Me flashlight is you flashlight naturally.  How can we not think to bring it?",ag,ag,fru
"Well, I hope the moon stays out.  Well, I wonder do they always wander during a full moon?  I can't remember, wasn't it full last year?  Do you remember?",q,q,xxx
yes.,ans,ans,neu
"Are you cold?  You want my jacket?  We should have bought a blanket.  Our blanket-.  This is great, isn't it?",s,s,exc
"I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the thing right about now. I can't believe I forgot.  And look at kid, I am surprise I make it out of the house about flies it.",s,s,exc
[LAUGHTER] I wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around,o,o,exc
I am cold.,s,s,xxx
you want my jacket?,q,q,exc
"It's after eleven, let's go home.",s,s,neu
"Are you kidding?  We'd miss it. We just got here, what's the point of coming out here if we are just going to leave.",q,q,xxx
There is no point in coming out here.,ans,ans,fru
Right.,ag,b,exc
That's my point.,s,s,xxx
That's my point too.,ag,ag,xxx
So let's go.,c,c,fru
"No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point in coming down here if we are just going to turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?",dag,dag,xxx
Not particularly.,ans,ans,neu
Why not?,q,q,fru
I just don't.,ans,ans,neu
"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity.",s,s,exc
"Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up.",s,s,exc
"Pass up what?  Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.",s,s,fru
"Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.",s,s,exc
This is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. Yeah,o,o,exc
"What are you so excited about?  I mean it's not--it's not rocket science we are talking about, its fish.  Its fish nobody even eats.",o,o,fru
Yeah they do.,dag,dag,xxx
Augie.,b,b,-
"Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that.",s,s,exc
There's There's mystery here and magic.  A little bit of the unexplainable.  I can't understand how you could not be interested.,o,o,exc
I am just not.,s,s,neu
For real?,q,q,sur
Yes.,ans,ans,neu
"I don't get it, the first time we came out here, you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited that you stuff your toe pushing me out of the door and you didn't notice it until you got into the car.",s,s,xxx
"Last year you also remember, our shoes got wet and I got sand in my panties and we got into a big fight.  You had a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.",s,s,fru
We weren't in a good spot.,o,o,fru
We didn't see them the first time either.,s,s,fru
We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I got a great instinct for these things.,o,o,xxx
"Look there, what's that?  Is it?  Is that a--Ah, it's a seaweed isn't it?",q,q,exc
"Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world.  I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second.",c,c,exc
"Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.",s,s,exc
It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.,s,s,exc
"They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up.",s,s,exc
That's the wind.,s,s,xxx
"Well, So what do you think?",q,q,exc
"Well, so?  What do you think?",q,q,exc
About what?,q,q,xxx
What I was just saying.,ans,ans,fru
It's ridiculous.,o,o,xxx
It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,dag,dag,neu
"It's PR, somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to occur on the beach.",o,o,xxx
"I am not the only one, look at all these people.",dag,dag,neu
"Yeah, they are all told the same thing.  They are all told that you know.  Gets them excited and they can't wait and that if they just get in on the right spot, than you than maybe life will start",o,o,xxx
Are we talking about the same thing?,q,q,xxx
I am sorry.  It's just fish to me.,ans,ans,fru
"Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?",q,q,neu
"God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.",o,ans,ang
What's bugging you?,q,q,fru
I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like.,ans,ans,fru
"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing.  And we say, Oh, wow.  Look at the little fish.  They go home, we go home.",s,s,fru
"For heaven's sake Augie, grow up we are not going to see the grunions.",o,o,fru
Why not?,q,q,fru
We never do.  Have we ever?  We never have.,q,q,fru
"We miss them twice, it's not ever.",ans,ans,fru
"Twice is every time we tried, that's ever.",s,s,fru
Well We will see them this year.,o,o,neu
"No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up.",dag,dag,fru
I thought you wanted to see it.,o,o,fru
"I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie.",o,o,fru
"It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over.",o,o,fru
"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",s,s,fru
"Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here.",s,s,fru
"When you are on the phone with Marge, everything was fine.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see, I took a shower and you were watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight and I said, great, let's go I am feeling lucky.",s,s,xxx
"Right, so I am putting on my jacket and putting up the animals and pulling the car out of the garage.",s,s,xxx
"Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.",s,s,sad
"We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.",s,s,sad
"And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",s,s,hap
"Wait a minute, I got it.",c,c,neu
"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.",s,s,sad
"It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's get some champagne.  And I said time wasting or something like that.  Right? of course.",q,q,xxx
I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.,ans,ans,sad

No.,ans,ans,sad
You want me to go get some champagne?,q,q,exc

No.,ans,ans,-
I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out.,ans,o,fru
What.  Welcome to the human race.,s,s,ang
"You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I propose I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road, we will end up on a beach arguing over fish.

"No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us.",o,o,fru
Because you know what Carla?  You know what you get?  This.,s,s,xxx

"No, I know me either.",dag,ag,sad

Maybe if you are with somebody else too?,o,o,sad
I didn't say that.,dag,dag,sad

Yeah?,q,q,xxx
"For heaven's sake, don't you know that?",q,q,xxx

"Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.",dag,dag,hap
Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.,o,o,hap
I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.,o,o,hap
"Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon.",o,o,hap
"Well, look what we have got here.",s,s,hap
"Augie, you bought refreshments.",s,s,xxx

Well than we don't need glasses.,s,s,xxx
Are you still cold?  You still want to go home?,q,q,xxx

I'm not the least bit drunk.,dag,dag,xxx
I think I mentioned once before that I had only three-minute liqueur glasses of brandy the entire evening long.  A child of two could not be drunk on that.,o,o,xxx

Might as well get started now? but Just take this one.,s,c,fru

"Sir, please don't waste my time.",ans,ans,fru
There is nothing I can do about it.  You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line.,s,s,fru
"Come on!  You know -- you can't just take -- make a little exception to the rule?  I know that you guys make exceptions.  I see -- you know, if I was-if I was your friend and you knew me, or something like that, you'd probably make a little exception for me wouldn't you?",q,q,fru

I'm gonna- I'm gonna bring security over and have them escort you out.,s,s,ang

yeah.,ag,b,neu
"It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance.",s,ans,neu

Oh really?,q,q,xxx
"Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection.  And it won't always be a bad connection, but it will be bad off and on.",ans,ans,neu
"Well, I- I can check that.  Is there anything else we can do, too?  Like, I'll go through and check the line throughout the house, but --",q,q,neu

"Uh, yeah looks -- no, no.  It's set to zeros.",ans,ans,neu
"It's set to zeros.  Okay, maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again.",o,o,neu
Okay.,b,b,-

I could hear him right through the floor in my room.,ans,ans,xxx
"What was he doing out there at that hour?  He's getting just like after Larry died, walking around at night.  He dreams.",o,o,xxx
I guess he is.,ag,ag,xxx
What's the meaning of that?,q,q,xxx
"I don't know the meaning of it, but you know one thing Mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.",ans,ans,xxx
What?,q,q,xxx
Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.,ans,ans,xxx
What do you mean dishonest?,q,q,xxx
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?,ans,ans,fru
"What do you want to do, argue with him?",q,q,fru
I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.,ans,ans,fru
"Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?",q,q,ang
You can't say that to him.,ans,ans,xxx
We have to say it to him.,c,c,fru
how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?,q,q,fru
For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!,ans,ans,ang
"To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?",q,q,fru
"Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",c,c,xxx
"The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.",s,s,ang
"All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you?",q,q,fru
Why?,q,q,xxx
You know.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, I have an idea.  But what's the story?",q,q,xxx
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, that's your business, Chris.",o,o,xxx
It's not just my business.,dag,dag,fru
"Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.",o,o,ang
So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?,q,q,fru
"Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't --",ans,ans,xxx
"Oh, so it isn't just my business?",dag,dag,ang
I'm just saying.,s,s,fru
You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.,o,o,ang
"Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",o,o,ang
"I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.",s,s,ang
She is not Larry's girl!,dag,dag,ang
"From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?",s,s,ang
"I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want, I have to pull back because I might hurt somebody else.  My whole bloody life; time after time after time.",o,o,fru
"Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that",o,o,neu
To hell with that!,dag,dag,ang
Have you asked Annie yet?,q,q,neu
I wanted to get this taken care of first.,ans,ans,xxx
"Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?",q,q,neu
"Well, if that's the case, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters it sounds like she has forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",ans,ans,xxx
"Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.",o,o,neu
So what?  I'm not fast with women.,ag,ag,ang
"Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.",s,s,fru
Because it is.,s,s,fru
"Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years.",s,s,fru
"I know her best, all right?  I don't know.  I grew up next to her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",q,q,fru
"No.  I don't want a -- look, your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because, I don't.",ans,ans,fru
"All right then, mom.",a,a,xxx
Just give it some more thought.,c,c,xxx
"I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.",s,s,ang
"But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.",s,s,ang
What the hell is this?,q,q,sur
"I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York.",ans,ans,ang
Are you crazy?,q,q,ang
I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.,ans,ans,ang
"What?  You mean?  Tell me something, you mean that you would leave the business?",q,q,xxx
"Yes.  On this, I would.",ans,ans,ang
You can't think like that.,s,s,xxx
"Well, you help me stay here.",c,c,ang
"All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.",s,s,ang
"I know that, mom.  Just, you help me stay here.",ag,ag,fru
Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?,q,q,ang
I am thinking that way.,ans,ans,xxx
"I don't understand you, do I?",q,q,fru
"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",ans,ans,fru
"Yeah, I can see that.",ag,s,fru
What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.,o,o,sad
He saw it.,s,s,xxx
"What do you mean?  I was the first one up, he was still in bed.",q,q,sur
He was out here when it broke.,ans,ans,sad
When?,q,q,xxx
About four this morning.  I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.,ans,ans,sad
What was he doing out here four in the morning?,q,q,xxx
"I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.",ans,ans,sad
Did you talk to him?,q,q,xxx
No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.,ans,ans,sad
He's dreaming about him again.  He's getting just like after Larry died. What's the meaning of that?,q,q,xxx
"Yes, yes he is.  I don't know the meaning in it.  But I know one thing, mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.",ans,ans,sad

Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.,ans,ans,xxx

I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time that he knows that nobody else believes that Larry's alive. I mean,ans,ans,fru
"Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for a long time?",q,q,fru
"Well, how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?",q,q,xxx
"For Gods sake, three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane!",ans,ans,fru
"To you it is and to me, but not to him.",s,s,xxx
You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?,q,q,xxx
"Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",c,c,xxx
"The trouble is the God damn newspapers, I mean, ea- each week a new boy turns up out of nowhere.  So the next one is gonna be Larry.  So you--",s,s,fru
"All right.  All right, just listen.",c,c,fru
"You know why I invited Annie, right?",q,q,xxx
Why?,q,q,xxx
You know.,ans,ans,xxx

She's not Larry's girl.,dag,dag,ang

Have you asked Annie yet?,q,q,neu
I wanted to get this settled first.,ans,ans,xxx

The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,o,o,neu
"So what, I'm not fast with women?",ag,ag,fru
I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,s,s,xxx
Because it is.,s,s,fru
"Well, that's a good reason.  But it don't mean a thing. I mean, You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.",s,s,neu
"[garbage] I don't know.  It's just,",s,s,fru
"she's who I know best. I know her since I- I was a kid I grew up with her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",s,s,fru
"No I don't want a-  Your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  If you marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.",s,s,fru

Are you crazy?,q,q,ang
"I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.  I'm through with it.",ans,ans,xxx
But you have a business here.  What the hell is this?,q,q,xxx
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ans,ans,ang
Must you be inspired?,q,q,ang
"Yeah, I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids.",ans,ans,ang
"I'd like to build something that's my own.  And Annie is in the center of that.  Now, where do I find it?",o,o,xxx
You don't want to think like that.,s,s,ang
"Well, you help me stay here.",c,c,xxx

Why did you invite her here?,q,q,xxx
Why does that bother you?,q,q,neu
"She's been in New York three and a half years, why all of a sudden?",q,q,xxx
"Well, maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again.",ans,ans,neu
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,o,s,neu
"What are you talking about?  He grew up next to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?  Don't look at me like that.  He hasn't told me anything he didn't told you.",q,q,fru
He's not going to marry her.,c,c,xxx
Why do you think he's even thinking that?,q,q,neu
He's got that about it.,ans,ans,neu
"Well, so what?",q,q,fru
"What's going on here, Joe?",q,q,ang
Now listen.,c,c,fru
"No.  She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",o,o,xxx
You don't know.  You can't read her mind.,o,o,xxx
"Then why is she still single? I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.",o,o,xxx
How do you know why she's waited?,q,q,fru
"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",ans,ans,xxx
"Look, it's a beautiful day outside, why are we arguing?",q,q,fru
"Nobody in this house dares takes her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",o,o,xxx
"Well, what do you want me to do about it?  What do you want?",q,q,fru
"I want you to pretend like he's coming back.  Both of you, don't think I haven't noticed you and Chris since she's gotten here.  I don't want any nonsense.",ans,ans,fru
But Kate?,b,b,fru
"No, because if she- he's not coming back then I'll kill myself. Laugh!  Laugh at me!",o,o,fru
But why did that happen the very night she came back?  She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it.,s,s,xxx
Calm yourself.,c,c,fru
"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",s,s,xxx
Calm yourself.,c,c,fru
Only last week a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.,s,s,fru
All right.  All right.,a,a,fru
You above all have got to believe.,c,c,ang
"What do you mean, me above all?",q,q,xxx
Just don't stop believing.,ans,ans,xxx
"What's that suppose to mean, me above all?  Look at you, you're shaking.",s,s,ang
I can't help it.,o,o,ang
"What have I got to hide, Kate?  What the hell is the matter with you?",q,q,ang
You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,s,s,neu
"I know.  It's going out of style, isn't it?",q,q,xxx
It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.,ans,ans,hap
"So, you're not sorry I came?",q,q,exc
No.  But I'm not going to stay.,ans,ans,xxx
Why?,q,q,sur
"Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave.",ans,ans,neu
Well-,b,b,neu
You saw that.  And well you've been --,s,s,xxx
What?,q,q,xxx
You've been sort of embarrassed since I got here.,o,ans,xxx
"Well, I planned on kind of sneaking up on you in a period of a week or so, but they all take it for granted that we're set.",s,s,xxx
"I figured they would, your mother at least.",ag,ag,neu
How did you know?,q,q,xxx
"Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?",ans,ans,neu
"Well, so would you want to?  I mean, I guess you know that's why I asked you to come.",q,q,xxx
"Yes, that's why I came.",ans,ans,xxx
"Annie, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you. -I",o,o,xxx
"I don't know what to say.  I have no imagination.  That's all I have to say to you.  God, I'm embarrassing you. I-I didn't want to do this here. I- I wanted to do it someplace different, someplace where we could be new to each other.",s,s,xxx
"You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything.",o,o,exc
"Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time.",s,s,hap
So he's gone forever then?  You sure?,q,q,xxx
I almost got married two years ago.,ans,ans,sad
Why didn't you?,q,q,sur
You started to write me.,ans,ans,xxx
You felt something that far back?,q,q,hap
Everyday since.,ans,ans,hap
"Annie, why didn't you call me or tell me?",q,q,xxx
"Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you sure can be ambiguous.",ans,ans,exc
"Give me a kiss, Annie.  Give me a --",c,c,xxx
"oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that?",o,o,exc
I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've sat around wondering if I was crazy for thinking of you.,o,o,xxx
"Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",o,o,exc
Not like that you're not.,o,o,exc
I kissed you.,s,s,sur
"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter?",q,q,sad
Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you.,s,s,sad
"No.  Chris, what is it?  Is it your mother?",q,q,xxx
"No, nothing like that.",ans,ans,sad
You have to tell me.,c,c,xxx
Even in your letters there was something ashamed.,s,s,sad
"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going for me.",ans,ag,sad
You have to tell me.,c,c,sad
I don't I don't know where to start.,s,s,neu
It wouldn't work like this.,s,s,sad
It's so mixed up with so many other things.,s,s,sad
"You remember when I was overseas, I was in command of a company?",q,q,xxx
"Yeah, sure.",ans,ans,neu
I lost them.,s,s,sad
How many?,q,q,sad
Just about all.,ans,ans,sad
"It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men.",o,o,sad
"For instance, there was this time, and it had been raining for several days, and this kid came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks, just put them in my pocket.",s,s,xxx
I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.,o,o,sad
"I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.",o,o,sad
"Everything was being destroyed see, but I felt like something new was being created at the same time.  Like it kind of -- responsibility.  You know, man to man.  Do you understand what I'm saying?",o,o,xxx
"And and to see that again, to to bring that back on the earth again, like- like a monument that that would stand behind these men and and and it would make a difference to them.",o,o,xxx
It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there.,s,s,sad
"I mean, the whole thing was like some kind of bus accident to them.",s,s,xxx
So I went back to work for my dad and that whole rat race again.,s,s,xxx
"I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.",s,s,sad
"It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean,",s,s,fru
"you can take those things out of the war, but if you're gonna drive that car you've got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man. And you've got to be a little bit better because of that.  Because if you're not, then it's all just loot and there's blood on it and I didn't want any of it.",o,o,fru
And I guess that included you.,o,o,sad
Do you still feel like that?,q,q,sad
"I want you now, Annie.",ans,ans,sad
"Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.",o,o,sad
"And you father, he put hundreds of planes in the air and you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",o,s,xxx
"Oh, Annie,",a,ag,exc
[LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune?,q,q,hap
Annie I am going to make you a fortune.,o,o,hap
"What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh, this is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though, so how are you doing?",q,q,exc
Fine.,ans,ans,sad
"What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think?",s,q,exc
"This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight.",s,s,exc
What flashlight?,q,q,neu
"The flashlight.  The silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?  Stupid.",ans,ans,exc
You mean our flashlight?,q,q,xxx
Well-,b,b,xxx
"I mean, you kept saying my flashlight, the flashlight like it was only somehow yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?",q,q,xxx
"Oh, no, of course, our flashlight.  Me flashlight is to you flashlight, naturally.",ag,ag,exc
"How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember?",q,q,exc
Yes.,ans,ans,xxx
"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.  Oh, this is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Oh, a six pack would be just the ticket right about now.",s,s,exc
"I can't believe I forgot.I'm like a little kid.  I'm surprised I made it out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh, [LAUGHTER]",o,s,exc
"Oh, I wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand. or something",o,o,exc
I'm cold.,s,s,xxx
Do you want my jacket?,q,q,exc
It's after eleven.  Let's just go home.,s,s,xxx
"Are you kidding?  We just got here, we'd miss it.  What's the point of coming all the way out here if we're just going to turn around and go home?",q,q,xxx
There is no point in coming out here.,ans,ans,xxx
Right.,ag,b,xxx
That's my point.,s,s,xxx
"That's my point, too.",ag,ag,xxx
So let's go.,c,c,xxx
"Oh, no, no, no.  no That's not my point.  My point is what's the point coming out here if we're just going to leave?  Don't you want to see it?",dag,dag,xxx
Not particularly.,ans,ans,xxx
Why not?,q,q,xxx
I just don't.,ans,ans,xxx
Oh,b,b,fru
it's stupid.,o,o,xxx
"Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.",s,s,exc
"I mean, Think about people in Kansas, they've got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up.",s,s,exc
Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.,s,s,fru
"Yeah, but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know,",s,s,exc
"and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that.",s,s,exc
"I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy.",o,o,exc
"What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science, this is just fish.  Fish nobody even eats.",o,o,fru
"Yeah, they do.",dag,dag,fru
Augie.,b,b,fru
"All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested.",o,o,exc
I'm just not.,s,s,sad
For real?,q,q,fru

"I don't get it.  I mean, the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life. And last year I remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn't even notice until you got in the car.",s,s,fru
"Well, if you also remember last year we- our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, we had a big argument, you had a sore throat, and we didn't see the grunion.",s,s,fru
We weren't in a good spot.,o,o,xxx
We didn't see them the first time either.,s,s,fru
We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got a great sense for these things.,o,o,xxx
"Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed.",s,s,exc
"Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second;",c,c,exc
somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-,s,s,exc
"And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name,",o,o,exc
"they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up.",s,s,exc
That's the wind.,s,s,xxx
"Well, so what do you think?",q,q,exc
"Well, so, what do you think?",q,q,exc
About what?,q,q,neu
What I was just saying.,ans,ans,exc
It's ridiculous.,o,o,neu
It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,dag,dag,fru
It's P.R. somebody sold you a bill of goods that this magical thing would be happening on the beach.,ans,o,xxx
"I'm not the only one, look at all these people.",dag,dag,xxx
"Sure.  Everybody is told the same thing, it keeps us all excited.  It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start now any minute if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action.",o,o,xxx
Are we talking about the same thing?,q,q,xxx
"I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me.",ans,ans,fru
"uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?",q,q,neu
"God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.",ans,ans,ang
What's bugging you then?,q,q,fru
I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.,ans,ans,fru
"It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home.",s,s,fru
"For God's sake, Augie.  It's- Grow up, we're not going to see the grunion.",o,o,xxx
Why not?,q,q,xxx
We We don't ever.  Have we ever?,q,q,fru
We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever.,ans,ans,fru
"Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever",s,s,ang
"Well, we'll see them this year.",o,o,xxx
"No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.",dag,dag,ang
"Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over.",o,o,fru
You don't understand anything I am saying.,s,s,fru
"No, of course not.",dag,ag,fru
I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.,o,o,sad
"I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so --",s,s,fru
"you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem.  All right.  So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.  And so, all right, and I'm putting on my coat, I'm putting out the animals, I'm pulling the car out of the garage.",s,s,fru
Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.,s,s,sad
"And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",s,s,sad
Wait a minute.  I've got it.,c,c,xxx
"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",s,s,sad
"It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?",q,q,neu
I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.,ans,ans,sad
"Okay.  All right No problem.  I totally understand. okey  um, listen.  Do you want to dance?",q,q,xxx
No.,ans,ans,sad
Do you want me to go get some champagne?,q,q,xxx
No.,ans,ans,sad
Take off our shoes?,q,q,xxx
No.,ans,ans,sad
"What, you want me to blow in your ear?",q,q,fru
[LAUGHTER] No.,ans,ans,xxx
"Do you want to get married again?- What?  What, do you want a divorce?",q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,-
No.,ans,s,xxx
A vacation?,q,q,fru
No.,ans,ans,sad
"A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want?",q,q,fru
I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.,ans,ans,sad
"Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?",q,q,ang
"Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!",q,q,ang
"Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",s,s,ang
This?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,s,s,xxx
"Yes, it is.",dag,dag,xxx
"Sure, this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",o,o,xxx
Right.,ag,ag,fru
But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.,o,o,sad
"Now, I know.  Me either",ag,ag,sad
"This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?",o,o,sad
I'm trying the best I can.,o,o,sad
"I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.",ag,ag,sad
But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.,o,o,sad
"Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?",o,o,sad
I didn't say that.,dag,dag,sad
"No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.",ag,ag,sad
"For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.",o,o,sad
Really?,q,q,sur
"Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.",ans,ans,sad
"Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.",dag,dag,hap
"Okay.  Well, we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.",o,o,xxx
"I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.",o,o,hap
"Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.",o,o,hap
"Oh, well look what we've got here.",s,s,hap
"Augie, you brought refreshments.",s,s,xxx
"Well, it isn't champagne.",s,s,hap
"Well, then we don't need glasses.",s,s,xxx
Are you still cold?  Still want to go home?,q,q,xxx
"No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.",ans,ans,hap
"Shh.  If we're really quiet, the fish might come.",o,o,xxx
Or not.,o,o,hap
Or not.,o,ag,hap
Oh Good God.,s,s,xxx
Do you think it's them?,q,q,fea
I wonder.,ans,ans,exc
"what, Nobody knows we are here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",s,s,exc
Must be them then?,s,s,fea
What do we do?,q,q,exc
"We're all right, aren't we, darling, whatever happens?",s,s,neu
"Now and always, my sweet.",ag,ag,exc
I don't care then.,s,s,exc
It was bound to happen sooner or later.,s,s,exc
Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.,s,s,xxx
"Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.",s,s,exc
"Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.",q,q,exc
Behave exquisitely.,ans,ans,xxx
With the worst- with the most perfect poise?,q,q,exc
I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.,ans,ans,xxx
"Uhh, It's amazing how once you feel--",o,o,exc
"things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?",q,q,exc
What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,ans,ans,xxx
"Uhh, You mustn't say that, my darling.",o,o,exc
"Well, it's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.",o,o,xxx
"Being that sacred and wonderful thing, love.",q,q,exc
Meaning just that.,ans,ans,xxx
"Um What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my endless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",q,q,exc
Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,c,c,neu
"You mustn't be serious, darling.  That's just what they want.",o,o,exc
Who's they?,q,q,neu
"All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them, Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.",ans,ans,exc
uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.,o,o,exc
"If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.",o,o,neu
Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun all right.,ag,ag,exc
"Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?",q,q,xxx
[garbage] who knows?,ans,ans,xxx
"Well, will we always bicker and fight?",q,q,neu
No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,ans,ans,exc
"Oh, dear.  Shall we like that?",q,q,xxx
"Well, it depends on how well we played.",ans,ans,xxx
"What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then?",q,q,neu
"Yes, yes, with all his might.",ans,ans,exc
"That's rather serious, isn't it?",q,q,xxx
"No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.",ans,ans,exc
"Darling, I do believe you're talking nonsense.",o,o,xxx
"So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children.",o,o,exc
"[garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets.",c,o,exc
"Elliott, worms don't pop.",s,s,neu
"I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best.",o,o,exc
"Uhh, Thank you, darling.  And the same goes for you, except that if I ever see you so much as look at another woman, I'll kill you.",o,o,xxx
Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,q,q,exc
Which particular one?,q,q,xxx
The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.,ans,ans,exc
"Awe, Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.",s,s,xxx
Horrible thing.  I hated it.,o,o,exc
I know you did.  You threw it out the window into the Canal below.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,ag,ag,exc
How long did that roue last?,q,q,exc
It went on intermittently for days.,ans,ans,xxx
"Oh, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown?",s,s,exc
"Oh, It burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom.",s,s,exc
"[LAUGHTER] That was quit a rouser, wasn't it?",q,q,exc
That was the first time you hit me.,ans,ans,xxx
"Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.",o,o,exc
"And then the manager came in and saw us all rolling all over the floor, biting and scratching one another. [LAUGHTER]",s,s,xxx
I should never forget his face. [LAUGHTER],s,s,exc
"How ridiculous, utterly ridiculous",o,o,xxx
We were very much younger then.,s,s,exc
Very much sillier.,o,o,xxx
"Come to think of it, the real cause of that roues was Peter Burden.",s,s,xxx
You knew there was nothing in that.,dag,dag,neu
Come to think of it the real cause of that roue was Peter Burden.,s,s,xxx
Oh You knew there was nothing in that.,dag,dag,xxx
I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.,s,s,xxx
Only a trivial little broach.,s,s,neu
"I remember it well, covered in diamonds and the worst possible taste.",s,s,xxx
Not at all.  I quite like it.  I wear it often.,dag,dag,neu
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,s,s,xxx
"[garbage], No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.",dag,dag,fru
You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he?,q,q,fru
"Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious.",ans,ans,neu
He let him kiss you.  You said you did.,s,s,fru
"Well, what of it.",q,q,neu
what of it?,b,b,xxx
Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,s,s,neu
What about me?,q,q,xxx
"Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never would have known about it.",ans,ans,xxx
"Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",o,o,ang
I'm getting very bored with this conversation.,o,o,fru
"Me, too, bored stiff.",ag,ag,ang
Do you want some brandy?,q,q,neu
No thanks.,ans,ans,neu
I think I'll have a little.,s,s,neu
I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses.,s,s,xxx
"No particular reason.  Besides, they were little ones.",s,s,xxx
"Well, it seems silly to go on and on with such a thing.",o,o,xxx
You can hardly say- You can hardly call three little liquor glasses of brandy for the entire evening going on and on.,o,o,xxx
It's becoming a habit with you.,o,o,neu
You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want me at the moment.,o,o,xxx
Don't be stupid.,c,o,fru
"Amanda, really.",dag,dag,ang
What?,q,q,xxx
"Nothing.  Are you going out somewhere, darling?",q,q,fru
Just making myself fascinating for you.,ans,ans,neu
"Um- Well, that reply has just broken my heart.",s,s,fru
"It's a woman's job to allure the man.  Watch me a moment, won't you?",o,o,xxx
"Oh, as a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",ag,ag,xxx
"No, it isn't.",dag,dag,ang
"Yes, it is.",dag,dag,xxx
"No, it it is not, be quiet.",c,c,ang
It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,o,o,ang
"hum, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.",o,o,xxx
"oh, Snap, snap, snap.  Like a little Adder.",o,o,xxx
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",dag,dag,xxx
"Nonsense, they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap!",dag,dag,fru
They sting.,dag,dag,fru
They snap.,dag,dag,ang
"Okay, I don't care if they roll about like hoops and bark, okay?",o,o,xxx
"So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?",q,q,neu
"Yes, I did quite a lot.",ans,ans,neu
"You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?",o,o,ang
[LAUGHTER] Mind your own business.,c,c,xxx
"I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway.",o,o,ang
You're quite insufferable.  I do imagine it's because you're drunk.,o,o,fru
I am not the slightest bit drunk.,dag,dag,ang
You always had a weak head.,o,o,neu
I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.,o,o,ang
"Oh, no on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass.",o,o,xxx
"Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?",q,q,ang
Not- Would you shut up.,ans,ans,ang
"You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots.",o,o,ang
"You're not very funny, dear.  You better have some more brandy.",o,o,fru
You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will.,ag,ag,ang
"You better turn that off, I think.",o,o,ang
Why?,q,q,xxx
Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.,ans,ans,ang
There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photography studio.,s,s,xxx
"Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose.",q,q,ang
They're away in Tunis.,ans,ans,xxx
This is no time of the year for Tunis.,o,o,ang
"Turn it on again, please.",c,c,xxx
I do I shall do no such thing.,dag,dag,ang
Very well.  If you have to be boorish and idiotic.,dag,dag,ang
Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,c,c,ang
You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,o,o,ang
Turn it off!,c,c,ang
Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you.,o,o,ang
Very amusing indeed.,dag,dag,ang
"You know what, I'm sick and tire of listening to you.  You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully.",o,o,ang
Ja! Very funny.,o,o,ang
"Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible.",o,o,ang
"You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again.",o,o,ang
This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end.,s,s,ang
"Oh, you're not going like this.",c,dag,ang
"Yes, I am. Let go with me",dag,dag,ang
"[GARBAGE] No, you're not.",dag,dag,ang
"You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you.  I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again.  Oh my God, never!",o,o,ang
oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.,s,s,ang
Beast,b,o,ang
You're a wicked little vampire.  And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live.,o,o,ang
